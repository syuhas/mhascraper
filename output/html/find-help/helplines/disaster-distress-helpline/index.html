<h2>Counseling Services</h2>
<p>The helpline puts people in need of counseling on the path to recovery. When you call or text, crisis counselors listen to what’s on your mind with patience and without judgment. DDH is staffed by trained counselors from a network of crisis call centers located across the United States, who provide: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis counseling for people in emotional distress</strong> related to any natural or human-caused disaster</li>
<li><strong>Information on how to recognize distress</strong> and its effects on individuals and families</li>
<li><strong>Referrals</strong> to local crisis call centers for additional follow-up care and support</li>
<li><strong>Healthy coping tips</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no need to give any identifying information when you contact DDH. The counselor may ask you for some basic information at the end of the call, but these questions are optional and intended to help SAMHSA keep track of the types of calls it receives.</p>
<h2>Who Can Call the Disaster Distress Helpline?</h2>
<p><strong>The helpline is open to anyone experiencing emotional distress related to disasters.</strong> This includes survivors of disasters; loved ones of victims; first responders; rescue, recovery, and relief workers; clergy; and parents and caregivers.

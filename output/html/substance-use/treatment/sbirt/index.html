<p>Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at-risk substance users before more severe consequences occur.</p>
<h2>About SBIRT</h2>
<p>The purpose of the SBIRT program is to implement the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment public health model for children, adolescents, and/or adults in primary care and community health settings (e.g., health centers, hospital systems, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred-provider organizations (PPOs) health plans, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), behavioral health centers, pediatric health care providers, children’s hospitals, etc.) and schools with a focus on screening for underage drinking, opioid use, and other substance use.</p>
<p>The SBIRT program effectively addresses substance use by integrating three core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screening quickly assesses the severity of substance use and identifies the appropriate level of treatment.</li>
<li>Brief intervention focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and motivation toward behavioral change.</li>
<li>Referral to treatment provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment with access to specialty care.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SBIRT Grant Program Success (2021-2023)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The SBIRT program served more than 450,000 individuals.</li>
<li>The percentage of clients who reported they had not used alcohol or illegal drugs within the past 30 days increased by 128.8% between initial screening to six-month follow-up.</li>
<li>Additionally, clients who reported experiencing no social consequences related to their drug use increased by 99.6% from initial screening to six-month follow-up.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Myra*, 17 years-old:</strong> The SBIRT interventionist met with Myra, a 17-year-old female in foster care to discuss her substance use. Myra had been seen at the CHECK clinic on three separate occasions in the past year and had spoken with the interventionist to discuss her substance use. She reported during the first visit that she smoked cannabis most days but not every day. She first started smoking at age 12. While Myra recognized the importance of quitting, she was not ready to make a plan to cut back or quit at that time. At her next visit to the clinic, she reported that she still did not want to create a plan. During Myra’s third clinic visit, the patient reported she was ready to quit. Myra reported that she had noticed an increase in the potency of her cannabis and was concerned about health outcomes if she continued to smoke. She reported that she was going to stop smoking altogether and identified supports that could help her achieve this goal. Myra also reported when she is tempted to smoke, she is going to drink water or eat fruit as a healthy replacement behavior. The SBIRT Interventionist praised her for taking the next step in quitting.</li>
<li><strong>Wanda*, 52 years-old:</strong> Wanda, a 52-year-old female presented to a community mental health agency. She had a long history of opioid use, numerous previous rehab admissions, and had struggled to maintain sobriety. The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) was administered, and the client scored into the Referral to Treatment category and was referred to a medication for addiction treatment program. Wanda has successfully participated in the program for the past six months. She continues to engage in therapy and medication for addiction treatment. Wanda is currently employed and says she has repaired relationships with family.</li>

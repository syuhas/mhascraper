<h2>Provider Education and Training</h2>

<h2>Development of Core Curriculum for Graduate Healthcare Education</h2>
<p>SAMHSA worked with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and experts from the field to expand the SUD health professions workforce through development of core curriculum on SUD for integration into all medical and health profession programs.</p>
<p>To build upon previous efforts, SAMHSA and ONDCP convened a panel of experts in August 2023 to review and draft core curricular elements or categories that should be incorporated into SUD curriculum.</p>

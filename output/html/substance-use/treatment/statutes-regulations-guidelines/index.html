It also shifted administrative responsibility and oversight of the program from FDA to SAMHSA.<br/> </li><li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/opioid-treatment-program/42-cfr-part-8"><strong>Revised 42 Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 8: Medications for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder</strong></a><br/>Published on February 2, 2024. This final rule modifies, and updates certain provisions of regulations related to Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) accreditation, certification, and standards for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in OTPs. This includes making flexibilities put forth during the COVID–19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) permanent, as well as expanding access to care and evidence-based treatment for OUD. The final rule also removes all language and rules pertaining to the Drug Addiction and Treatment Act (DATA) Waiver from the regulations pursuant to the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023”.<br/> </li><li><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/02/2024-01693/medications-for-the-treatment-of-opioid-use-disorder"><strong>42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 8</strong></a><br/>Provides for an accreditation and certification-based system for OTPs, overseen by SAMHSA, and includes regulations for using opioid drugs to treat OUD. The regulation shifted administrative responsibility and oversight of these treatments from FDA to SAMHSA. The regulations acknowledge that OUD is a medical disorder and that different patients, at different times, could need vastly different treatment services. The regulations also preserve states’ authority to regulate OTPs. Oversight of treatment medications used in MOUD remains a multilateral system involving states, SAMHSA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).<br/> </li><li><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2"><strong>42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 2</strong></a><br/>On February 8, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Office for Civil Rights announced a final rule modifying the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulations at 42 CFR part 2.

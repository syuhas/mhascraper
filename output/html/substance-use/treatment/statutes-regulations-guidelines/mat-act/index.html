<div class="card card-body">
<p><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2">42 CFR Part 2</a> privacy protections apply to federally assisted programs, which are substance use disorder practitioners who hold themselves out as providing, and who do provide, SUD treatment services, as well as substance use disorder treatment facilities. Practitioners who prescribe buprenorphine only need to follow Part 2 (e.g., written consent to share records and security of records, etc.) if they meet the definition of a “federally assisted program” as defined in 42 CFR 2.11 and 42 CFR 2.12(b), namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they receive any type of federal assistance in the provision of services; and</li>
<li>If they work in a standalone SUD treatment program that holds itself out as providing, and provides, SUD services; or</li>
<li>If they work in an identified SUD unit of a general medical facility that holds itself out as providing, and provides, SUD services; or</li>
<li>Their primary function consists of providing SUD services and is identified as such.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many practitioners in general medical facilities do not meet these criteria. Therefore, Part 2 generally does not apply to their patient records and they do not need to follow Part 2 – even if they prescribe buprenorphine. HIPAA protections still apply.</p>

<p>No. This change expands access to buprenorphine by eliminating the need for practitioners to apply for the DATA-Waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, and eliminates the patient caps that were previously applicable to practitioners who prescribed buprenorphine for OUD treatment.

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1681972">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>Because many patients will have other behavioral health conditions, like anxiety and depression, capacity to treat or refer to counseling is strongly recommended as an evidenced-based practice, but is not required. Although people often focus on the role of medications in treating OUD, counseling and behavioral therapies that address psychological and social needs may also be extremely helpful to patients as part of a holistic treatment plan. However, an inability to provide these services, or patient refusal of such interventions, should not prevent practitioners from prescribing buprenorphine. The decision as to when counseling and other services, such as case management and peer support, should be made in conjunction with the individual patient.</p>
<p>Opioid Treatment Programs provide counseling, case management and peer support for people with OUD and may be good resources. Local counseling services can be found through <a href="https://findtreatment.gov">SAMHSA’s Treatment Locator</a>.</p>

<p>An often-cited barrier to prescribing buprenorphine is the perception that patients must engage in counseling and other services in order to start or continue receiving the medication. While counseling and other services form part of a comprehensive treatment plan, the provision of medication should not be made contingent upon participation in such services.</p>
<p>An important treatment principle is to provide interventions in a person-centered manner. This means assessing and taking into account a person’s stage of change<sup><a href="#1">1</a> </sup>as treatment begins and progresses, incorporating the patient’s goals and priorities into the treatment plan, and applying a shared decision-making approach. It also means that counseling and other services can and should be offered as individuals stabilize on buprenorphine and progress in their treatment and recovery. Many studies have indicated that counseling services provide patients with the tools to manage their condition, achieve and sustain better health, and improve their quality of life.<sup><a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a> </sup>Indeed, many individuals with SUDs have complex issues that may impact treatment and for which medication alone may be insufficient for optimal outcomes. In addition, several studies of patients undergoing treatment with buprenorphine have demonstrated greater treatment adherence and lower health care utilization when the medication is combined with counseling.<sup><a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>As stated above, the decision as to when counseling and other services, such as case management and peer support, should be made in conjunction with the individual patient. Additionally, the evidence base does not provide direction on the type of counseling or services that might be optimal for patients at different stages of treatment and recovery progression. This reflects the person-centered nature of treatment interventions, as well as the need for practitioners to work with patients and to meet them where they are in order to support sustained recovery.</p>
<p>Given the elevated risk of fatal overdose without medication therapy, any difficulty in connecting patients with counseling and behavioral health resources should not prevent practitioners from prescribing buprenorphine. This is not to say that patients shouldn’t be offered counseling and other services. It instead reflects the understanding that engaging people with OUD and other SUDs in treatment is complex and can begin with stabilization on medication. As with any chronic condition, treatment planning should meet people where they are, be supportive, person-centered, and collaborative.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Millions of people in the U.S. live with a substance use disorder. In 2016, there were 20.1 million people, or 7.5 percent, aged 12 or older in 2016 who had a substance use disorder in the past year. In addition, an estimated 8.2 million U.S. adults 18 or older reported having co-occurring disorders. This means that within the previous year, they experienced both a mental illness and a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>Health care providers are often the first contact for addressing their patient’s substance use disorder. There is ample evidence that those who have a substance use disorder often have feelings of shame that impede treatment-seeking. Therefore, it is essential health care providers understand that negative attitudes, beliefs and language can be barriers that prevent those in need from seeking services, or even sharing information, including being in recovery.</p>
<h2>About the Webcast Series: The Power of Perceptions and Understanding</h2>
<p>SAMHSA, in partnership with<a href="https://www.recoveryanswers.org"> Massachusetts General Hospital, Recovery Research Institute</a>, produced a four-part webinar series was developed to educate healthcare professionals about the challenges of discriminatory practices and inaccurate perceptions in treating individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) and related conditions, as well as those living in recovery. The series emphasized the harm caused by negative perceptions and prejudicial behaviors and highlighted the importance of adopting non-discriminatory approaches to improve care and outcomes for these individuals.</p>

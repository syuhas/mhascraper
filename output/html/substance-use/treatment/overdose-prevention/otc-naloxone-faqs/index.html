<p>The coverage of nonprescription Narcan 4mg naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray, once it is available, may vary depending on the source of health coverage. As Narcan 4mg transitions to an “over-the-counter” product, some health plans may cover the cost, while others may not. In some cases, a prescription may be required for both prescription and non-prescriptions forms of naloxone to be covered, even if it is available for purchase without a prescription. It is important for individuals to check with their health coverage program, health plan or health insurance issuer regarding coverage for nonprescription “over-the-counter” naloxone and any requirements or restrictions on coverage. State Medicaid programs may or may not cover OTC drugs. States may cover OTC drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries using state-only funds or may choose to cover OTC drugs under Medicaid when prescribed by professionals authorized to do so under state laws and regulations.

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1616086">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>Opioid medications (like Vicodin, Percocet, and Norco) and illicit opioids (like heroin or illicitly manufactured fentanyl) work by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the brain. When this happens, they can cause someone’s breathing to slow down, something known as respiratory depression. Sometimes this respiratory depression can be so significant that it reaches the point where people stop breathing completely. Naloxone is a medication that is not an opioid but can also bind to the same opioid receptors. When it does, it blocks the effects of opioids and rapidly reverses respiratory depression, allowing someone to breathe again.</p>
<p>When given immediately after an overdose, naloxone is a highly effective medication to reverse respiratory depression and it has an excellent safety profile. In fact, naloxone generally only has an effect when someone has taken an opioid. Naloxone has been shown to be a critical tool in preventing opioid overdose deaths. In addition to being used by healthcare professionals, naloxone is increasingly being distributed to first responders, family members, and other bystanders who may witness an opioid overdose. The availability of nonprescription naloxone could help to further increase its distribution and accessibility, potentially saving more lives and reducing the burden of opioid overdose on individuals, families, and communities.</p>

<p>It is advisable to administer naloxone and call 911 immediately if there is any suspicion of opioid overdose, even if the person is believed to be using other drugs, or the drug is unknown. Administering naloxone in these situations can help prevent irreversible harm.</p>
<p>Many non-opioid drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, as well as pills obtained from the illicit drug market, have been found to be contaminated with opioids like illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Additionally, some people may use opioids in conjunction with other substances. This increases the risk of unintentional opioid overdose, particularly for individuals who do not typically use opioids. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that even if a person does not think they are using opioids, they may still be at increased likelihood of experiencing an opioid overdose if the drugs they are using are contaminated with opioids such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl. In such cases, giving naloxone can be lifesaving. It is crucial to note that naloxone is effective in reversing the effects of opioids, but it will generally not harm someone if opioids are not present in their system.</p>

<p>Naloxone is a relatively safe medication when used appropriately to reverse opioid overdose. However, it is important to note that naloxone can cause withdrawal symptoms in people who have had an overdose reversed since they may be physically used to having opioids in their system. Opioid withdrawal symptoms include agitation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and elevated heart rate. These symptoms are typically not life-threatening and can be treated. It is important to recognize the signs of opioid overdose and to administer naloxone quickly and appropriately and to follow up with a health care professional. The benefits of naloxone use in preventing opioid overdose deaths far outweigh the risks.</p>

<p>Administering naloxone to someone who is not experiencing an opioid overdose is safe and generally should not cause harmful health effects. Therefore, if someone is unsure whether an individual is experiencing an opioid overdose or not, it is still recommended to administer naloxone and call 911 immediately. This is because the potential benefits of administering naloxone and potentially saving a life outweigh the risks of not administering it.</p>

<p>The appropriate amount of naloxone to give depends on several factors, including the severity of the opioid overdose, the specific form of naloxone being used, and the individual's response to the medication.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> In cases where the overdose involves illicitly manufactured fentanyl, which is increasingly common, people may need to administer multiple doses of naloxone to effectively reverse the overdose. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl comes in many different forms, each with varying degrees of strength, making it difficult to determine the exact dose of naloxone needed to reverse the overdose in some cases. It is essential to follow the directions on the naloxone medication packaging carefully and to be aware of any specific guidance related to waiting between doses. It is also important to understand that naloxone may not immediately make someone responsive, and it may take a few minutes for the individual to begin breathing normally again. Therefore, it is crucial to continue monitoring the person’s condition and to seek emergency medical attention immediately. While administering naloxone can be lifesaving, it is essential to recognize that overdose reversal with naloxone can be complicated, particularly in cases involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Indeed, there are some reports of fentanyl causing chest wall rigidity which requires intervention with naloxone and breathing support.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> For this reason, it is always important to stay with the individual who has overdosed, and to call 911 as soon possible after giving naloxone, to ensure continued safety and well-being.</p>

<p>Should people still call 911 in the event of an overdose, even if they have naloxone?</p>
</button>
</h4>
<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1616091">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>Yes. While administering naloxone can be a critical step in reversing an opioid overdose and saving a life, it is still important to call 911 in the event of an overdose, even if naloxone has been administered. This is an important step outlined in the Drug Facts Label of Narcan 4mg naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray. Naloxone works to reverse the effects of opioids on the body for a limited period, typically 30 to 90 minutes depending on the specific form and dosage of naloxone used. However, many opioids can last longer than this, and it is still possible to experience the effects of an overdose after naloxone wears off. Additionally, emergency responders can provide additional medical care if the person is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from the naloxone and transport the person to a hospital, if necessary, which may be essential in ensuring their safety and well-being. Calling 911 can also ensure that the individual receives appropriate treatment for other conditions, and follow-up care and support, such as substance use treatment or connection with a peer support specialist, as needed, which can be critical in addressing the underlying causes of drug use and preventing future overdose.</p>

<p>Nonprescription drugs are required to be safe and effective for use without oversight or training by a healthcare professional. Nonprescription naloxone has consumer-friendly labeling that contains all the key information needed for an untrained bystander to administer naloxone. However, administering naloxone can be stressful and confusing for some individuals, particularly if they have not received training or have limited experience in responding to medical emergencies. Therefore, individuals who may witness an opioid overdose, such as family members, friends, or other caregivers, are encouraged to receive some training on how to recognize the signs of opioid overdose and how to administer naloxone correctly. Additionally, specific instructions on administering naloxone are included in the packaging of the nonprescription naloxone, making it easy to follow in an emergency. It is also important to note that training in providing rescue breaths can be an important tool in responding to an opioid overdose, particularly if the individual is not breathing.</p>

<div class="card card-body">
<p>Including naloxone in the workplace first aid kit is recommended as part of an overall effort to promote workplace safety and protect employees from the risks associated with opioid overdose. In recent years, many employers have recognized the importance of addressing the opioid overdose epidemic in their workplaces, particularly as opioid misuse and addiction continue to have significant impacts on public health and the economy. Including naloxone in the workplace first aid kit is an important step in this effort, as it can help ensure that employees can help their colleagues who may be at increased likelihood of opioid overdose have access to this life-saving medication in the event of an emergency. Additionally, providing training to volunteer staff on how to administer naloxone can help increase the likelihood of a positive outcome and minimize potential complications or risks associated with its use. This is already happening in many workplaces, particularly those in industries where opioid misuse may be more prevalent, such as healthcare, law enforcement, and construction. However, it is important for all employers to consider including naloxone in their workplace first aid kits and to provide appropriate training and support to employees who may need to use it. This can help promote workplace safety and ensure that employees have the resources they need to stay healthy and well.</p>

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1667668">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>Several HHS grant programs, such as SAMHSA’s State Opioid Response (SOR) program, allow for the purchase and distribution of naloxone for states and territories. While these grants are not solely focused on naloxone, they are an important tool in addressing the opioid overdose epidemic and promoting access to life-saving resources for individuals with increased likelihood of overdose. The SOR grant recipients (i.e., states and territories) and sub-awardees are required to use SAMHSA's grant funds primarily to support direct services, which includes the purchase and distribution of naloxone. The Tribal Opioid Response (TOR) grant program similarly allows Tribal grantees to use federal funds for the purchase and distribution of naloxone. Other grant programs, such as FR-CARA, Prescription Drug Overdose, and Harm Reduction, also provide for grantees to purchase and distribute naloxone as part of their efforts to address the opioid overdose epidemic. HRSA-supported health centers and Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) grants also allow grant recipients to purchase and distribute naloxone in underserved and HRSA-designated rural areas.</p>
<p>The FDA-approval of nonprescription status for the Narcan 4mg naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray (and other nonprescription naloxone nasal spray products) should have minimal impact on these and other grants in the short-term, as grantees and sub-recipients will be able to continue to purchase and distribute naloxone products as they have done in the past. But while naloxone is a critical tool in preventing opioid overdose deaths, it is just one component of a larger effort to address opioid misuse and addiction. Therefore, SAMHSA and HRSA grants continue to support a comprehensive approach to the overdose crisis, including prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery efforts, while also prioritizing access to naloxone and other life-saving resources.</p>

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1667672">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>Ensuring that naloxone is available in communities with the highest risk of opioid overdose, including rural and underserved areas, is an important priority for public health officials and community organizations. There are several strategies that can be used to help promote access to naloxone in these communities. Strategies can include stocking nonprescription naloxone products in pharmacies and other retail settings, healthcare providers prescribing naloxone to patients who are at risk for opioid overdose, community-based programs such as harm reduction programs that distribute naloxone, and distributing naloxone at treatment facilities and emergency departments.</p>
<p>It is important for Federal agencies to work with community-based organizations, departments of public health, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to identify individuals and groups who are at highest risk of opioid overdose, and to ensure that they have access to naloxone and training on how to use it. That way, those who are most likely to witness or respond to an overdose, including people who use drugs, their friends and family members, and first responders, will have access to this medication.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to focus naloxone distribution efforts on locations where opioid overdoses are most likely to occur. This involves working with local law enforcement agencies, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to identify high-risk areas and ensure that naloxone is available in these locations. To help communities plan for naloxone distribution, all 50 states and 8 territories that received SOR grant funding were required to submit a Naloxone Saturation Plan in their FY22 grant applications. As part of this plan, applicants were required to describe a focused distribution and communication strategy to get the appropriate type of naloxone into the hands of those most likely to witness an overdose and in the locations where they are most likely to occur. SAMHSA is working closely with States as they continue to refine their plans to address gaps and get naloxone into the hands where it is most needed, and the National Institutes of Health funds research on how implementation of naloxone availability and other tools can help prevent fatal overdoses.</p>

<div class="card card-body">
<p>In addition to the recent action to approve Narcan 4mg naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray as a nonprescription drug and maintaining standing orders for prescription formulations of naloxone, there are many other policies and strategies that have been implemented to prevent opioid misuse and overdose. A highly effective strategy is increasing access to substance use disorder treatment, such as medications for opioid use disorder, and accompanying behavioral therapies. These interventions have been shown to improve retention in treatment, reduce opioid use, and decrease the risk of overdose. Additionally, increasing access to harm reduction services such as syringe services programs, fentanyl testing strips, and overdose prevention education can reduce the risk of overdose and promote safer drug use practices. These services can also provide opportunities to connect individuals with other support services, such as housing and employment assistance, which can help address underlying issues contributing to substance use.</p>
<p>Other policies that can be implemented to prevent opioid misuse and overdose include increasing funding for research on pain management and non-opioid pain treatments, implementing prescription drug monitoring programs to track prescribing patterns and identify potential misuse, and improving access to mental health services for individuals with substance use disorders. Additionally, policies that address the social determinants of health, such as poverty and housing insecurity, can help reduce the risk of substance use by addressing risk factors for addiction. Ultimately, a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex factors contributing to opioid misuse and overdose is necessary to effectively prevent and address this public health crisis.</p>

<p>In 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and SAMHSA issued final regulations to establish a new oversight system for the treatment of <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use">substance use disorders (SUDs)</a>. New federal regulations transferred administrative responsibility over the use of opioid medications in maintenance and detoxification treatment of SUDs from the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) to SAMHSA (see <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-01693/medications-for-the-treatment-of-opioid-use-disorder">Certification of Opioid Treatment Programs, 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 8</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, the regulations established procedures to approve nonprofit groups or state governmental entities to become a SAMHSA-approved accrediting body.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/opioid-treatment-program/accreditation-bodies">SAMHSA-approved accrediting bodies</a> evaluate opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and perform an accreditation survey to ensure SAMHSA’s opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment standards are met.</p>
<p>SAMHSA’s <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/opioid-treatment-program">Division of Pharmacologic Therapies (DPT)</a> provides guidance to entities that wish to participate in SAMHSA’s OTP certification program and become an accreditor of <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/treatment/options/medications#counseling-behavioral-therapies">OTPs</a>.

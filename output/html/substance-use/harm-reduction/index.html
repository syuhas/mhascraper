<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h2>Harm Reduction at SAMHSA</h2>
<p>Harm reduction is a practical and transformative approach that incorporates community-driven public health strategies — including prevention, risk reduction, and health promotion — to empower people who use drugs (and their families) with the choice to live healthy, self-directed, and purpose-filled lives. Harm reduction centers the lived and living experience of people who use drugs, especially those in underserved communities, in these strategies and the practices that flow from them.</p>
<p>Harm reduction emphasizes engaging directly with people who use drugs to prevent overdose and infectious disease transmission; improve physical, mental, and social wellbeing; and offer low barrier options for accessing health care services, including substance use and mental health disorder treatment.</p>
<p>Organizations who practice harm reduction incorporate a spectrum of strategies that meet people where they are ― on their own terms, and may serve as a pathway to additional health and social services, including additional prevention, treatment, and recovery services.</p>
<p>Harm reduction works by addressing broader health and social issues through improved policies, programs, and practices.</p>

<span aria-hidden="true" class="visually-hidden">Why are Harm Reduction Services Needed?</span>
<div class="block-content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h2>Why are Harm Reduction Services Needed?</h2>
<p>The U.S. is experiencing the most significant substance use and overdose epidemic it has ever faced, exacerbated by the recent worldwide pandemic, and driven by the proliferation of highly potent synthetic opioids (containing fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) and animal tranquilizers (like xylazine) into many types of drugs (including stimulants and counterfeit prescription pills).</p>
<p>There were more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">100,000 drug-involved overdose deaths</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Harm reduction offers an opportunity to reach people who aren’t otherwise accessing healthcare services ― and offer them naloxone to reverse an overdose, and help connect them to other needed services. As an example, treatment services (such as medications for opioid use disorder) can be co-located with harm reduction services and offered as an option.</p>
<p>This potential connection to treatment is critical, when the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health">data</a> show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only around one out of ten people with a substance use disorder have received treatment.</li>
<li>Nearly all people with a substance use disorder who didn’t get treatment at a specialty facility didn’t think they needed treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Harm reduction organizations can fill that gap ― by providing services that people do feel they need, in order to make positive change.</p>
<p>Harm reduction services save lives by being available and accessible in a manner that emphasizes the need for humility and compassion toward people who use drugs. Harm reduction plays a significant role in preventing drug-related deaths and increasing access to healthcare, social services, and treatment. These services decrease overdose fatalities, acute life-threatening infections related to unsterile drug injection, and chronic diseases (such as HIV and hepatitis C).</p>
<p>It is ideal to implement <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-022-00639-z#Tab2">overdose education and naloxone delivery (OEND) programs</a> at syringe services programs. (Most <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f174">studies</a> that demonstrate OEND’s effectiveness focus on programs that deliver OEND services directly to people who use drugs.) Naloxone distribution at syringe services sites has been found to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524734/">significantly reduce death rates</a>. Scaling these efforts is a priority strategy to achieving adequate availability of (and access to) naloxone.</p>

<div class="block-content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h2>Harm Reduction's Place in and Among Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery</h2>
<p>Harm reduction is part of a comprehensive prevention strategy and the continuum of care. Harm reduction approaches have proven to prevent death, injury, disease, overdose, and substance misuse. Harm reduction is effective in addressing the public health epidemic involving substance use as well as infectious disease and other harms associated with drug use.</p>
<p>As an approach, harm reduction emphasizes kindness and autonomy in the engagement of people who use drugs. It also increases the number of touchpoints (and opportunities) that peers and/or service providers have with people who use drugs.</p>
<p>Specifically, harm reduction services can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect individuals to overdose education, counseling, and referral to treatment for infectious diseases and substance use disorders.</li>
<li>Distribute opioid overdose reversal medications (e.g., naloxone) to individuals at risk of overdose, or to those who are likely to respond to an overdose.</li>
<li>Lessen harms associated with drug use and related behaviors that increase the risk of infectious diseases, including HIV, viral hepatitis, and bacterial and fungal infections.</li>
<li>Reduce infectious disease transmission among people who use drugs (including those who inject drugs) by equipping them with sterile supplies, accurate information and facilitating referrals to resources.</li>
<li>Reduce overdose deaths, promote linkages to care, facilitate co-location of services as part of a comprehensive, integrated approach.</li>
<li>Reduce stigma associated with substance use and co-occurring disorders.</li>
<li>Promote a philosophy of hope and healing ― by employing people with living and lived experience in leadership and in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of services. People with lived experience can also model for their peers what meaningful change can look like in their lives.</li>
<li>Build community and increase protective factors ― for people who use drugs and their families.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAMHSA's Current and Future Support for Harm Reduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grants-dashboard?f%5B0%5D=by_award_fy%3A2022&amp;f%5B1%5D=by_nofo_number%3ASP-22-001#awards-tab">SAMHSA awarded 25 grants</a> in FY 2022 for its first-ever Harm Reduction grant program. This funding, authorized by the American Rescue Plan, will help increase access to a range of community harm reduction services and support harm reduction service providers as they work to help prevent overdose deaths and reduce health risks often associated with drug use. SAMHSA accepted applications from State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, Tribal organizations, non-profit community-based organizations, and primary and behavioral health organizations.</p>
<p>SAMHSA is distributing up to $9,750,000 per year (or $29,250,000 over 3 years). Grant recipients receiving federal funding must adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other requirements as specified in federal grant terms and conditions of award. Other SAMHSA grants may also support harm reduction activities (see <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grants-dashboard?f%5B0%5D=by_nofo_fy%3A2023">Notice of Funding Opportunities</a>).</p>
<p>The following harm reduction services/supplies are allowable costs that may be covered with certain SAMHSA funds:</p>

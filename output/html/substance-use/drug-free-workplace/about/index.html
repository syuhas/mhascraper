</ol>
<h2>Federal Workplace Programs</h2>
<p>Federal drug-free workplace programs are comprehensive programs to address illicit drug use by federal employees. SAMHSA's Federal Drug-free Workplace Program certifies executive branch agencies' Drug-Free Workplace Plans and identifies safety-sensitive positions subject to random drug testing.</p>

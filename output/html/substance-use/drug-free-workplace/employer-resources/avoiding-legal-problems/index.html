<p>The following best practices are helpful for all organizations that strive for a drug-free workplace:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consult an employment attorney:</strong> The American Bar Association or your state bar association can refer you to a qualified employment attorney. Consult with your attorney whenever you alter your drug-free workplace policy, or if you’re launching a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Set clear penalties:</strong> Clearly stipulate the penalties for policy violations. If your policy includes a drug-testing program, state who will be tested, when they will be tested, and what will happen to employees with a violation.</li>
<li><strong>Put it in writing:</strong> Every employee should receive and sign a written copy of your drug-free workplace policy. Verbal agreements and unsigned agreements have little legal standing.</li>
<li><strong>Provide training:</strong> Ensure that all supervisors are trained on how to detect and respond to workplace drug and alcohol misuse. Maintain attendance logs of all trainings.</li>
<li><strong>Document employee performance</strong>: Maintain detailed and objective records on the performance of all employees. A documented performance issue often provides a basis for referring workers to employee assistance programs (EAPs).</li>
<li><strong>Don’t rush to judgment:</strong> Do not take disciplinary action against a worker or accuse a worker of a policy violation simply because the employee's behavior seems impaired. Instead, try to clarify the reasons for the employee's impairment. If drug testing is a part of your workplace policy, obtain a verified test result before taking any action.</li>
<li><strong>Protect privacy:</strong> Hold discussions with employees about potential violations in private. Have another manager present to serve as a witness. Never accuse or confront an employee in front of his or her coworkers.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> No individual employee or group of employees should receive special treatment. Inconsistencies in enforcement could be considered discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Know your employees:</strong> Getting to know your employees can make it easier to identify problems early on.</li>
<li><strong>Involve employees:</strong> Workers at all levels of your organization should be involved with developing and implementing your drug-free workplace policy. This will reduce misunderstandings about the reasons for having a drug-free workplace program and help ensure that your policies and procedures are fair to everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Employers who follow these basic steps, and who strive to create programs that are fair, consistent, and supported by all stakeholders, will set a foundation for staying on the right side of the law.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Many federal contractors and all federal grantees are required by law to establish and maintain a drug-free workplace policy.</p>
<p>The most important piece of legislation regulating federal contractors and grantees is the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2009-title41/pdf/USCODE-2009-title41-chap10.pdf">Drug-free Workplace Act of 1988 (PDF | 210 KB)</a>. Under the act, a drug-free workplace policy is required for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any organization that receives a federal contract of $100,000 or more</li>
<li>Any organization receiving a federal grant of any size</li>
</ul>
<p>At a minimum, such organizations must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare and distribute a formal drug-free workplace policy statement. This statement should clearly prohibit the manufacture, use, and distribution of controlled substances in the workplace and spell out the specific consequences of violating this policy.</li>
<li>Establish a drug-free awareness program. This program should inform employees of the dangers of workplace substance use; review the requirements of the organization's drug-free workplace policy; and offer information about any counseling, rehabilitation, or <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit/provide-support">employee assistance programs (EAPs)</a> that may be available.</li>
<li>Ensure that all employees working on the federal contract understand their personal reporting obligations. Under the terms of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, an employee must notify the employer within five calendar days if he or she is convicted of a criminal drug violation.</li>
<li>Notify the federal contracting agency of any covered violation. Under the terms of the Drug-free Workplace Act, the employer has 10 days to report that a covered employee has been convicted of criminal drug violation.</li>
<li>Take direct action against an employee convicted of a workplace drug violation. This action may involve imposing a penalty or requiring the offender to participate in an appropriate rehabilitation or counseling program.</li>
<li>Maintain an ongoing good faith effort to meet all the requirements of the Drug-free Workplace Act throughout the life of the contract. Covered organizations must demonstrate their intentions and actions toward maintaining a drug-free workplace. Their failure to comply with terms of the Drug-Free Workplace Act may result in a variety of penalties, including suspension or termination of their grants/contracts and being prohibited from applying for future government funding.</li>

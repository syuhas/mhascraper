<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><h2>Why a Drug-Free Workplace?</h2>
<p>If you have <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources#laws">legal requirements</a> for a drug-free workplace policy and program and comply with those requirements, you will reduce the chances that your organization will experience legal issues. First, you will be meeting the requirements of the law. Second, you will be able to reduce drug-related accidents and the liability issues and lawsuits that can arise from such accidents.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the legal requirements, consider putting in place a drug-free workplace policy and program that addresses the specific issues and needs in your workplace. Issues and needs can be identified by <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit/access-your-workplace">assessing your workplace</a>. This approach increases the likelihood that you will achieve positive results in the form of reduced drug use and related problems.</p>

<h2>Components of a Drug-Free Workplace</h2>
<p>Drug-free workplace programs can help employers create safe, cost-effective, and healthy workplaces. Most successful drug-free workplace programs have five key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit/develop-policy">A written policy</a></strong> forms the foundation of your drug-free workplace program. At minimum, your policy should include the rationale for the policy, such as organizational goals and compliance with laws or regulations; expectations for compliance, including who, what, when, and where; assistance options to support employees in following the policy; and consequences for violating the policy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit/provide-support"><strong>Employee Education</strong></a> for employees at all levels to be prepared for the implementation of the drug-free workplace policy and program. Everyone in the organization needs information about the problems associated with substance misuse. Be sure to provide education and training that reinforces healthy attitudes and behaviors and deepens awareness on how substance misuse can affect employee health and employment.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit/supervisor-training"><strong>Supervisor Training</strong></a> can help maximize the effectiveness of your drug-free workplace policy and program. Supervisors should be well-informed about the policy and program and be aware of legally sensitive areas. They must also be trained on how to document potential problems in a fair and systematic manner, honor confidentiality, and refer employees to appropriate services. Supervisors may also need training on how to help employees reintegrate into the workplace after receiving services.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/drug-testing-resources"><strong>Drug Testing</strong></a> is one way to protect your workplace from the negative effects of substance misuse. Conducting drug testing may help your organization comply with federal regulations or insurance carrier requirements. It can improve workplace safety and reduce costs from misuse of alcohol and other drugs in the workplace. A drug-testing program can also deter employees from coming to work unfit for duty.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a id="the-toolkit" name="the-toolkit"></a>The Drug-Free Workplace Toolkit</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/toolkit">Drug-Free Workplace Toolkit</a> supports workplace health and safety by providing information to help employers develop and sustain successful drug-free workplace programs.</p>
<h2><a id="eap" name="eap"></a>Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) Toolkit</h2>
<p>EAPs are designed to help employees with personal problems that may affect their job performance. Although some EAPs focus on problems related to alcohol and other drugs, most address a range of issues and can provide a variety of services. The <a href="https://www.eapassn.org/">International Employee Assistance Professionals Association (EAPA)</a> has developed certification procedures for EAP providers.</p>

<h2><a id="laws" name="laws"></a>Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>If you are considering adopting a drug-free workplace policy or drug-free workplace program, you may have many questions and concerns. You might ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this something I really have to do?</li>
<li>What, exactly, is being required of me?</li>
<li>Will it be expensive?</li>
<li>Will it make my employees angry or resentful?</li>
<li>Can I get into trouble if I do something wrong?</li>
<li>How do I avoid getting sued?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all legitimate concerns. Organizations failing to comply with federal, state, and local requirements for a drug-free workplace can face severe penalties and may even face lawsuits filed by workers. Read more:</p>

</ul>
<p>The best way to avoid legal problems is to hire an employment lawyer to help develop the workplace policy. This will help ensure that the new policy is consistent with all of the required rules and regulations. For an overview of best practices for complying with legal requirements, review <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/drug-free-workplace/employer-resources/avoiding-legal-problems">10 Steps for Avoiding Legal Problems</a>.</p>
<p>But it is also important for employers and their employees to understand their own legal rights and obligations. Otherwise, employers may make serious and costly legal mistakes in the way that they implement policies. As a result, employees may feel wronged, persecuted, or deprived of personal power.</p>

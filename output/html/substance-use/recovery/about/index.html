<p>Hope, the belief that these challenges and conditions can be overcome, is the foundation of recovery. A person’s recovery is built on his or her strengths, talents, coping abilities, resources, and inherent values. It is holistic, addresses the whole person and their community, and is supported by peers, friends, and family members.</p>

<div class="block-content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>The process of recovery is highly personal and occurs via many pathways. It may include clinical treatment, medications, faith-based approaches, peer support, family support, self-care, and other approaches. Recovery is characterized by continual growth and improvement in one’s health and wellness and managing setbacks. Because setbacks are a natural part of life, resilience becomes a key component of recovery.</p>
<h2>The Four Major Dimensions of Recovery</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Health </strong>- Overcoming or managing one’s disease(s) or symptoms - for example, abstaining from use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and non-prescribed medication if one has an addiction problem- and for everyone in recovery making informed, healthy choices that support physical and emotional well-being</li>
<li><strong>Home </strong>- Having a stable and safe place to live</li>
<li><strong>Purpose - </strong>Conducting meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors, and the independence, income, and resources to participate in society</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong> - Having relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope</li>
</ol>

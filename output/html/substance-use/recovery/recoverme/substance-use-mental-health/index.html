Throughout your recovery, taking care of your mental health while improving your relationship with drugs and/or alcohol makes setbacks less likely and improves your mind, body, and overall wellbeing.</p>
<h2>The Connection Between Substance Use and Mental Health</h2>
<p>Millions of young adults are living with mental health or substance use conditions, and many are living with both. It’s important to understand how substance use and mental health are connected and how improving one positively impacts the other.</p>
<p>Substance use and mental health conditions may be connected because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain drugs or alcohol can cause people to experience symptoms of a mental health condition.</li>
<li>Mental health challenges can sometimes lead to alcohol or drug use, as some people with a mental health condition may misuse these substances as a form of self-medication.</li>
<li>Substance use and mental health conditions share some underlying causes, including brain chemistry, genetics, stress, or trauma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signs of a Mental Health Condition</h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s hard to tell if you’re experiencing normal stress or experiencing bigger mental health challenges. Some early signs that you may be experiencing a mental health condition include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling helpless or hopeless</li>
<li>Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual</li>
<li>Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried, or scared</li>
<li>Having low or no energy</li>
<li>Feeling numb or like nothing matters</li>
<li>Having persistent thoughts and memories you can't get out of your head</li>
<li>Thinking of harming yourself or others</li>
</ul>

<p>The campaign's primary goal is to increase the number of young adults who are taking steps toward long-term recovery. To support this, the campaign will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness about the connection between substance use and mental health.</li>
<li>Improve the belief among young adults that recovery is possible, and many effective options exist to support their unique journey.</li>
<li>Reduce perceived stigma about recovery, substance use, and mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Priority Audiences</h2>
<p>The primary audience is young adults, aged 18â€“25, who currently are and want to continue to be in recovery. The campaign will also reach young adults who want to be in recovery and are in an active process to get help with their drug and/or alcohol use and mental health challenges.</p>
<p>SAMHSA recognizes that substance use and mental health conditions can affect young adults in unique ways and are shaped by personal experience, background, and geographic location. This campaign will consider these influences to ensure support is relevant to all young adults.</p>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<p>Strategic partnerships are key to amplifying the impact of the campaign and reaching its goal. Understanding the importance of community, RecoverMe relies on its partners to serve as trusted messengers and increase the reach and resonance of campaign messages.</p>

<h2>Why RecoverMe Matters</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH%202023%20Annual%20Release/2023-nsduh-main-highlights.pdf">2023 National Survey on Substance Use and Health (PDF | 642 KB)</a>, nearly half (49.6%) or 16.0 million young adults aged 18 to 25 reported having a mental health or substance use condition in the past year. <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Through carefully crafted resources and tools, RecoverMe supports young adults and considers their mental health needs and substance use challenges, together.

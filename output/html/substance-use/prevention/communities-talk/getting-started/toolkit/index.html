From getting started to putting your event out there for the world to see, the information and assets below will be your strategic guide.</p>
<p>Youth-led activities and events are always encouraged. Consider involving youth at the start of your process to gain their insights and ideas and invite their leadership of the activity.</p>

<p>Crafting a good plan is the best way to ensure a successful event. Below we have collected all that <em>Communities Talk</em> hosts need to think through their event and get it into gear.</p>
<h3>Five Steps for Planning Your Event</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Review SAMHSA’s <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/technical-assistance/sptac/framework">Strategic Prevention Framework</a> and <a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/product/focus-prevention/sma10-4120">assess your community’s needs</a>. </strong>Consider how you can apply this framework to your <em>Communities Talk</em> activity.</li>
<li><strong>Define your goals and objectives. </strong>Use your community assessment to spark discussions about what your community needs most and who can be part of the solution. Are you creating awareness about an issue? Are you inviting feedback on public policies related to underage drinking or marijuana? Are you launching a new prevention tool or program to combat fentanyl overdoses? Be specific and stay on point throughout the planning process.</li>
<li><strong>Organize a planning committee. </strong>Consider collaborating directly with youth and young adults to sketch out the activity content and messaging, as well as with different sectors of the community such as:
	<ul>
<li>law enforcement</li>
<li>elected officials</li>
<li>faith-based organizations</li>
<li>businesses</li>
<li>schools</li>
<li>parent groups</li>
<li>health care professionals</li>
<li>local colleges and universities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determine your activity type, day, time, and location.</strong> <em>Communities Talk</em> activities should take place anywhere a community gathers, virtually or in-person, to have an open discussion.<br/>
	Example: Community and youth-led groups in Oregon held a community forum on fentanyl and drug awareness at the local high school to explore substance misuse policy/legislation (e.g., social host laws; liquor license laws and regulations). Speakers spanned all sectors of the community with the goal to have “frank conversations” about the substances impacting their community and how they can support each other so that youth don’t turn to substances, no matter what they are going through.<br/>

<li><strong>Prepare to capture the moment.</strong> Arrange for a photographer, even if an amateur, to get photos or videos of the day. Having this element will help bring your Prevention Story to life! Make sure the footage shows the full breadth of your event, from who participated to where it was held. Below are a few tips for doing this well:

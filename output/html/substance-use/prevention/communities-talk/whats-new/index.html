<p>Access New Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the Communities That HEAL (CTH) Intervention: A Community-Driven Approach to Reduce Overdose Deaths</p>
</button>

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1689055">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>In 2019, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and SAMHSA launched the <a href="https://hcs.rti.org/">HEALing Communities Study (HCS)</a> to determine the impact of the data-driven Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The four-year study engaged 67 communities to rapidly deploy evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio.</p><p>The <a href="https://hcs.rti.org/communities-that-heal-intervention.html">CTH intervention</a> is a multi-phased approach created by a team of opioid-overdose reduction experts that uses data and leverages community partnerships to help inform decision-making and support the uptake of evidence-based strategies to reduce overdose deaths. As part of the CTH, researchers collaborated with community coalitions to develop the Opioid-Overdose Continuum of Care Approach (ORCCA)—a framework to help communities select and implement effective practices best suited to their needs. The ORCCA menu includes strategies proven to reduce overdoses, such as opioid education and naloxone distribution, medication treatment for opioid use disorder, and safer opioid prescribing and dispensing practices.</p><p>HCS has developed a new resource that breaks down each phase of the CTH program for potential adopters into seven manageable “Road Maps.” The Road Maps serve as a step-by-step guidebook for implementing activities in each phase.</p><p>Road Maps include:</p><ul><li>Phase 0: Preparation</li><li>Phase 1: Getting Started</li><li>Phase 2: Getting Organized</li><li>Phase 3: Community Profiles and Data Dashboards</li><li>Phase 4: Community Action Planning</li><li>Phase 5: Implement and Monitor</li><li>Phase 6: Sustainability Planning</li></ul><p>Learn more at <a href="https://hcs.rti.org/communities-that-heal-intervention.html">Communities That HEAL (CTH) Intervention</a>.</p>

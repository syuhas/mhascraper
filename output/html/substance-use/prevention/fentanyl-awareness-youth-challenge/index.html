<p><strong>How can young people be a part of the solution to increase awareness about the risks of fentanyl?</strong></p>
<p>In this Challenge, we are seeking the best ideas from U.S. youth, aged 14-18, on a community strategy to increase youth awareness, education, and prevention around the dangers of fentanyl, especially the hidden dangers of fake pills and other contaminants that can lead to drug overdose deaths.</p>
<p>These are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Among adolescents age 10-19, from 2019 to 2021:
	<ul>
<li>Monthly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7150a2.htm#:~:text=During%20July%202019%E2%80%93December%202021%2C%20a%20total%20of%201%2C808%20adolescent,May%202021%20(Figure%201)">drug overdose deaths</a> increased 109%.</li>
<li>Deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyls increased 182%.</li>
<li>About 90% of these deaths involved opioids and 84% involved illicitly manufactured fentanyls.</li>
<li>Counterfeit pills were present in nearly 25% of these deaths.</li>
<li>Two-thirds of those who died had one or more potential bystanders present, but most didn’t provide overdose response (many bystanders were in another room or didn’t know that drugs were being used).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criminal drug networks are mass-producing <a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill">fake pills</a>, and falsely marketing them as legitimate prescription pills. They are made to look just like prescription drugs such as oxycodone (Oxycontin<sup>®</sup>, Percocet<sup>®</sup>), hydrocodone (Vicodin<sup>®</sup>), and alprazolam (Xanax<sup>®</sup>); or stimulants like amphetamines (Adderall<sup>®</sup>).
	<ul>
<li>7 out of 10 fake prescription pills (seized by the DEA) contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xylazine (often known as “tranq”), is a central nervous system depressant and animal tranquilizer that has been showing up in combination with fentanyl and has been involved in a growing number of overdose deaths.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the best way to make your friends aware of these risks and keep them safe? <strong>You</strong> have the answers. <strong>You</strong> are a trusted resource with your friends and in your community. <strong>You</strong> are an important part of the solution.</p>
<p>SAMHSA wants <strong>you</strong> to pitch your idea that educates youth in your community (among your friends, or at school, or within an organization to which you belong) about fentanyl and fake pills, and prevents overdose. Your idea could include any innovative ways to reach youth on this topic like social media posts, vlogs, podcasts, video journals, etc.</p>

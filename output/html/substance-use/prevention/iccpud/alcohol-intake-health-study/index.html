The Subcommittee will serve as an ongoing subcommittee of the ICCPUD to provide leadership, oversight, and consultation related to the review of current scientific evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake and related health outcomes. The Subcommittee comprises ICCPUD member agency representatives who are responsible for guiding and setting policies or have scientific expertise in alcohol intake and health research. The Subcommittee includes representatives from the following agencies:</p><ul><li>U.S. Department of Agriculture</li><li>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health</li><li>Agency for Health Care Research and Quality</li><li>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</li><li>Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy</li><li>Indian Health Service</li><li>National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute</li><li>National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</li><li>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</li></ul><p>The ICCPUD Subcommittee will review all available literature, synthesize the data and conclusions from the Scientific Review Panel. The Subcommittee will assess the scientific evidence provided by the SRP in conjunction with the NASEM study findings related to health effects of alcohol intake among adults and provide a synthesis of the data and summarize the science for the 2025 Report to Congress. This information will also be provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</p><h2>Scientific Review Panel</h2><p>As part of its regular activity, ICCPUD is supporting a Scientific Review Panel (SRP), comprised of external scientific experts, that will analyze the current scientific evidence on youth and adult alcohol intake and health risks and provide outcomes and findings to the Subcommittee.</p><p>The alcohol intake and health study will be conducted by experts in disease prevention and public health and include scientists from diverse backgrounds representing a range of career levels including mid-career researchers. The Subcommittee has expertise on alcohol consumption in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Public health strategies related to alcohol policies, programs, and practices</li><li>Alcohol epidemiology</li><li>Health effects of alcohol</li><li>Dietary guidance policy</li><li>Cancer epidemiology</li><li>Data quality and analysis</li><li>Systematic reviews</li><li>Biostatistics</li></ul><p>Biographies and financial disclosures of SRP members:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/iccpud-srp-aih-bios-2024.pdf">SRP Biographies (PDF | 286 KB)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/iccpud-srp-aih-financials-2024.pdf">SRP Financial Disclosures (PDF | 288 KB)</a></li></ul><h2>Developing a Scientific Protocol and Methodology</h2><p>A <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/iccpud-scientific-methodology-protocol-aih-study-2024.pdf">Scientific Protocol and Methodology of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study (PDF | 656 KB)</a> will be developed for performing a series of studies assessing the relationship between alcohol intake and related health conditions; these studies will be completed by leading experts with experience conducting meta-analyses, relative risk estimates, and systematic reviews related to alcohol intake and health. The studies will assess the current, best, and most applicable scientific evidence on the relationship between consumption of alcohol and health outcomes in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Chronic alcohol use and the development of health conditions</li><li>Estimates on the relationship between alcohol use and injury risk</li><li>Lifetime risks of alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity by alcohol intake</li><li>Burden of disease in the United States related to alcohol intake and health</li></ul><p>The SRP will conduct a series of studies on alcohol intake and health, providing the best available science to the Subcommittee on the implications of alcohol intake and health, including on the relationship between chronic alcohol use and health conditions, the relationship between alcohol use and injury risk, lifetime risks of alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity, and U.S. burden of disease related to alcohol intake and health. The SRP will provide all study findings related to alcohol use and health to the Subcommittee.</p><p><strong>Exhibit 1: Organizational Structure of the Alcohol Intake and Health Review Process</strong></p><p><img alt="Diagram showing that ICCPUD over saw the Technical Review Subcommittee for Alcohol Intake &amp; Health and the Scientific Review Panel for Alcohol Intake &amp; Health.

On December 28, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriation Act mandated a study with NASEM to review evidence on alcoholic beverages and health. Throughout 2023, ICCPUD and NASEM conducted formative work, including establishing contracts, developing study plans, and forming expert panels. NASEM held public committee meetings on January 25–26 and March 28, 2024. The ICCPUD Alcohol Intake and Health Study hosted a public meeting on August 7, 2024. In the fall of 2024, the DGAC is expected to release its scientific report, followed by study reports from NASEM and ICCPUD in December 2024. In 2025, ICCPUD plans to hold another public meeting, with the date to be determined, and HHS &amp; USDA are set to release the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025–2030, with the release date also yet to be determined. Notably, ICCPUD and NASEM conducted overlapping but complementary reviews between 2023 and 2025." src="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/alcohol-intake-health-timeline-thumb.png"/></p><h2>Background</h2><p>The ICCPUD first began its work in looking at factors affecting underage alcohol use including the relationship between alcohol consumption and health among youth and adults in December 2021 as part of the ICCPUD operational and data committee meetings. This work was included as part of the 2021 ICCPUD Comprehensive Plan. In February of 2022, two members of the ICCPUD (the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) representative and the US Department of Agriculture representative) requested that the ICCPUD undertake a study on alcohol consumption and health to provide greater input on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans related to alcohol. In April 2022, this request was approved, and the ICCPUD, operating on behalf of the HHS Secretary, proceeded to establish a Technical Review Subcommittee to begin the work to conduct the studies and identify leading experts in alcohol.</p><p>It is important to note that HHS and USDA have a long history of engaging Federal interagency workgroups to conduct scientific reviews and provide information to inform the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The request to the ICCPUD is not unique. Examples of separate processes and subcommittees that have been used in forming recommendations for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in the past, include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Healthy Food Environments (<a href="https://www.thecommunityguide.org/pages/about-community-preventive-services-task-force.html">CDC Community Preventive Service Task Force</a>)</li><li>Oral Health (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/index.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/oral-health">NIH</a>)</li><li>Food Safety (<a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/">FoodSafety.gov</a>)</li><li>Specific Nutrient Recommendations (<a href="https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/dietary-guidelines/dietary-reference-intakes">Dietary Reference Intakes</a>)</li><li>Human milk, infant formula, and health outcomes (<a href="https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/breastfeeding-health-outcomes/research">AHRQ systematic reviews</a>)</li><li>Seafood (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish">FDA/EPA Advice about Eating Fish</a>)</li><li>Eating Disorders (<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders">National Institute of Mental Health</a>)</li><li>Physical Activity (<a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PDF | 14.6 MB)</a>)</li><li>Evaluation of nutrition intake compared to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations (<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/related-projects#uswds-text-738">Healthy Eating Index</a>)</li><li>Consumer education on the Dietary Guidelines (<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/related-projects#uswds-text-4097">MyPlate Consumer Education Resources</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/related-projects#uswds-text-4080">White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health</a></li></ul></div>

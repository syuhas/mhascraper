<h2>Get bad grades</h2>
<p>Children who use alcohol have higher rates of academic problems and poor school performance compared with nondrinkers.</p>
<h2>Suffer injury or death</h2>
<p>In 2009, an estimated 1,844 homicides; 949,400 nonfatal violent crimes such as rape, robbery, and assault; and 1,811,300 property crimes, including burglary, larceny, and car theft were attributed to underage drinking.</p>
<h2>Engage in risky sexual activity</h2>
<p>Young people who use alcohol are more likely to be sexually active at earlier ages, to have sexual intercourse more often, and to have unprotected sex.</p>

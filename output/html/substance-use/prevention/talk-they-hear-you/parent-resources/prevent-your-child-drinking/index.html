<h2>Be Aware of Factors That May Increase the Risk of a Child’s Alcohol Use, Including:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Significant social transitions such as graduating to middle or high school or getting a driver’s license;</li>
<li>A history of social and emotional problems;</li>
<li>Depression and other serious emotional problems;</li>
<li>A family history of alcoholism; and</li>
<li>Contact with peers involved in troubling activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be a Positive Adult Role Model.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from alcohol in high-risk situations. For example, do not operate a vehicle after drinking alcohol.</li>
<li>Get help if you think you have an alcohol-related problem.</li>
<li>Do not give alcohol to your children. Tell them that any alcohol in your home is off limits to them and to their friends.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work With Schools, Communities, and the Government to Protect Children From Underage Alcohol Use by Ensuring That:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Schools and the community support and reward young people’s decisions not to drink;</li>
<li>Schools and the community identify and intervene with children engaged in underage drinking early;</li>
<li>Rules about underage drinking are in place at home, at school, and in your community;</li>
<li>Agreements of acceptable behavior are established, well-known, and applied consistently; and</li>
<li>Parties and social events at home and elsewhere do not permit underage drinking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support Your Children and Give Them Space to Grow.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be involved in your children’s lives.</li>
<li>Encourage your children’s growing independence, but set appropriate limits.</li>
<li>Make it easy for your children to share information about their lives.</li>
<li>Know where your children are, what they are doing, whom they are with, and whom they are friends with.</li>
<li>Make an effort to get to know the parents of your children’s friends. Share your rules about not allowing alcohol use.</li>
<li>Find ways for your children to be involved in family life such as doing chores or caring for a younger sibling.</li>
<li>Set clear rules, including rules about alcohol use. Enforce the rules you set.</li>
<li>Help your children find ways to have fun without alcohol.</li>
<li>Do not let your children attend parties at which alcohol is served. Do not allow alcohol at parties in your own home.</li>
<li>Help your children avoid dangerous situations such as riding in a car driven by someone who has been drinking.</li>
<li>Help your children get professional help if you are worried about their involvement with alcohol.</li>
<li>Create a pledge between yourself and your children that promises they will not drink alcohol.</li>

<p>SAMHSA’s new “Talk. They Hear You.” campaign mobile app helps parents and caregivers prepare for some of the most important conversations they may ever have with their kids. It shows them how to turn everyday situations into opportunities to talk with their children about alcohol and other drugs, and equips them with the necessary skills, confidence, and knowledge to start and continue these conversations as their kids get older. The app also helps prepare communities to implement and promote the campaign locally and educators to engage student assistance professionals, school leaders, and families in supporting the needs of students who may be struggling with substance use, mental health, or school-related issues. The “Talk. They Hear You.” campaign mobile app is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talk-they-hear-you-campaign/id1476093222">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.samhsa.talktheyhearyou">Google Play</a>, and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NSGX3421RFT">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>

<p>The “Talk. They Hear You.”® campaign features original prevention soundtracks in its <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/talk-they-hear-you/community-partners/psas">public service announcements (PSAs)</a> encouraging parents and caregivers to have conversations about underage drinking and substance use prevention with their children. Prevention messages are woven throughout the lyrics, inspiring many small conversations between parents and children that can <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/talk-they-hear-you/parent-resources/small-conversations">make a big impression</a>.</p>
<p>The soundtracks feature Emmy Award–winning songwriter and producer Eren Cannata, and musicians Liberty DeVitto, Richie Cannata, Julio Fernandez, Tony Tino, Chris Clark, Carrie St. Louis, George Panos, Amir Royale, and Nicole Raviv. Actress Torrey DeVitto plays violin in “You’ve Been Through,” inspired by her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8TpsE60K20">own experience</a> growing up on the road with her musician father and the impact real-life conversations about alcohol and other drugs had on her health and safety growing up.</p>

<p>The latest soundtrack, “By Your Side,” is inspired by the role other adult role models, such as educators and student assistance professionals, play in the lives of youth and their decisions when it comes to use of alcohol and other substances.</p>

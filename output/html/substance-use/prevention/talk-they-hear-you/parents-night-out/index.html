<p>SAMHSA’s new “Talk. They Hear You.” campaign “Parents’ Night Out” educational sessions aim to inform parents and caregivers about the realities of underage drinking and other drug use, prepare them to talk with their kids about these issues, and motivate them to start these important conversations.</p>
<p>The “Parents’ Night Out” materials are intended to be used for community implementation of interactive, facilitator-led sessions that can be held either virtually or in person. <a href="https://43925259.hs-sites.com/parents-night-out-landing-page">Comprehensive toolkits are available for download</a> and include all materials needed to implement either a single one hour-long “Parents’ Night Out” session or a series of three one hour-long program sessions. The “Parents’ Night Out” toolkits contain everything you need to plan, prepare, and host an event(s) in your community.</p>

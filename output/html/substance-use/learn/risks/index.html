<p>The pressures on adults are real. Building careers, buying homes, getting married, having kids, and trying to do it all well comes with a lot of pressure. COVID-19 has magnified the stress. Some turn to drugs to cope. Just because some drugs are legal, doesn’t mean they are less dangerous.</p>
<p>Over time, the regular or habitual use of drugs becomes a crutch and only adds to the stress. Drugs can also cause other harms, including:</p>
<p>Before the risks become real and before drugs turn your life—and your family—upside down, know there is help. You can quit.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Drug Use for Adults Ages 26-49</h2>
<p>While young adults ages 18-25 have the highest rates of drug use across the board, drug use among adults ages 26-49 is on the rise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cocaine:</strong> Highly addictive, cocaine is involved in nearly one in five overdose deaths; its health effects include asthma, bowel decay, and increased risk of HIV.</li>
<li><strong>Methamphetamine (Meth):</strong> Meth causes <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/stimulants">devastating health effects</a>, and sometimes death, even on the first try. Meth speeds up the body’s systems to dangerous levels. Chronic users experience anxiety, confusion, insomnia, paranoia, aggression, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Prescription and illicit opioids:</strong> Highly addictive, the substances are the top cause of overdose deaths; health effects include confusion, nausea, constipation, coma, and brain damage.</li>
<li><strong>Marijuana:</strong> Even though it is legal in many states, studies link marijuana use to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/marijuana/risks">various negative outcomes</a>.</li>
<li>The percentage of adults age 26 and older using marijuana daily or almost daily has nearly doubled since 2015.</li>
<li>Cocaine use and death rates have risen; cocaine-involved overdose rates in the U.S. have risen annually since 2012.</li>
<li>Meth use is on the rise and overdose death rates climbed more than five-fold for those ages 25 to 54 between 2011 and 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nation remains in a prescription and illicit opioids crisis, as 81,230 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S.—the highest single year ever reported—in the 12 months ending in May 2020; most of the overdose deaths involved a prescription or illicit opioid.</p>

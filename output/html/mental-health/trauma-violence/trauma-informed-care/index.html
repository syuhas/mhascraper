<h2>What is trauma?</h2>
<p>Trauma happens after an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that someone experiences as physically or emotionally harmful or threatening. It can have a negative effect on a person’s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. Entire generations, communities, or cultures can experience trauma collectively.</p>
<h2>What is trauma-informed care?</h2>
<p>Trauma-informed care is a way to create safer environments for people who have experienced trauma. Programs and organizations that use trauma-informed care:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realize how trauma affects people and understand potential paths for recovery and healing</li>
<li>Recognize the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, and staff</li>
<li>Respond by creating policies, procedures, and practices that reflect knowledge about trauma</li>
<li>Resist or avoid retraumatization</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the goals of the Task Force?</h2>
<p>The Task Force identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best practices for supporting children, youth, and families affected by trauma</li>
<li>How Federal agencies can better respond to trauma, like substance use disorders, in families</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task Force History</h2>
<p>The Task Force was established on October 13, 2018 — of Public Law 115-271, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act of 2018.</p>

<h2>Highlights from the July 2024 Trauma-Informed Summit</h2>
<p>In July 2024, the Task Force gathered experts from across the country whose work has focused on implementing trauma-informed approaches at a systems level. We invited them to share their work as part of our annual summit. The theme of the summit was The Power of Federal Collaboration in Trauma-Informed Care: Moving from Awareness to Action.</p>
<p>Over 2 days, we engaged in meaningful discussions that focused on our need to expand how we think about trauma-informed care — including how to address individual and systemic trauma. The following are snippets from the summit that bring together insights on the levels of trauma and creating safer spaces:</p>

The “Levels of Trauma” video provides considerations for changing our thinking about trauma and how to apply this change in practice.</p>

The “Safer Spaces” video provides thoughts on evolving our concept of safer spaces and ways to build them.</p>

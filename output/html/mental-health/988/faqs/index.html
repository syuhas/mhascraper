<p>When you call 988, you will hear a greeting message, followed by a menu of choices that offer you the option to connect you to specially trained counselors for Veterans, service members, and their families (through the <a href="https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/">Veterans Crisis Line</a>, operated by the Veteran’s Administration), Spanish speakers and LGBTQI+ youth and young adults. If you choose one of these services, your call is then routed to the service you have chosen. If you do not choose a service, you will be connected to a local 988 Lifeline crisis contact center based on either your approximate location or your phone’s area code. You can bypass the menu options by dialing zero.</p>
<p>You will hear music until a skilled, caring crisis counselor answers the phone. Once you are connected, your counselor will, introduce themselves, ask you about your safety, listen to you, and work to understand how your problem is affecting you. They will provide personal, judgment-free support and share resources that may be helpful. If your local crisis contact center is unable to take your call, you are automatically routed to a national backup crisis contact center.</p>
<p>If you speak a language other than English or Spanish, the 988 Lifeline uses Language Line Solutions to provide interpretation to callers in more than 240 additional languages. There is no cost to you for language interpretation.</p>

<p>Yes, the 988 Lifeline works. Numerous studies have shown that most Lifeline callers are significantly more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed, and more hopeful after speaking to a 988 Lifeline crisis counselor. 988 Lifeline counselors are trained to help reduce the intensity of a situation for the person seeking help and connect them to additional local resources, as needed, to support their wellbeing.</p>
<p>Most people who reach out to the 988 Lifeline are helped by the crisis counselor, resources shared, or community connections made (without involvement of 911) during the call, text, or chat.</p>

<p>At the time of publishing these FAQs, average time for a crisis counselor to answer after the greeting menu options is typically under a minute. Sometimes, the wait may be longer; please stay on the line. Your connection is important, and a caring counselor will respond as soon as they can. You can see average wait times on SAMHSA’s <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/988/performance-metrics">988 Performance Metrics webpage</a>. Wait times shown on the 988 Performance Metrics webpage are calculated from the time your call, text, or chat is routed to the service you have chosen.</p>
<p>The people answering the 988 Lifeline are located in more than 200 local, state, and territory-run crisis contact centers. They will listen, support, assess your situation, share resources, and make community connections. 988 crisis contact centers may have variations in wait times, and wait times may be impacted by the time of day.</p>

<p>SAMHSA’s longer-term vision is that the transition to the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, which began in July 2022, will continue to promote the growth of a robust crisis care system across our country that links callers to community-based providers who can deliver a full range of crisis care services (like mobile crisis teams or stabilization centers). Currently, these crisis care services do not exist in all areas of the country, and it will take time and sustained support for this crisis care system to evolve.</p>

<p>How is 988 different from 911?</p>
</button>
</h2>
<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion active" id="accordionBody1668285">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>The 988 Lifeline connects people with trained counselors who provide emotional support, crisis de-escalation, and connections to local community resources without relying on law enforcement or emergency medical intervention unless necessary.</p>
<p>911 is the primary contact for emergencies involving medical emergencies, fire, crimes in progress, or other situations requiring immediate physical intervention. Although 911 is highly effective for emergencies involving physical harm and public safety concerns, it is not specialized to manage behavioral health crises.</p>
<p>SAMHSA is working towards a long-term vision of strong coordination between the two services so people in crisis get to the most appropriate care needed in that moment. SAMHSA is actively working with 911 counterparts at the federal, state, and local levels as our country continues to improve crisis care systems.</p>
<p>Currently, a small percentage of 988 Lifeline callers require activation of the 911 system, and many of those are done with the consent and cooperation of the caller. This occurs when there is an imminent risk to someone’s life that cannot be reduced during the 988 Lifeline call. In these cases, the crisis counselor shares information with 911 that is crucial to saving the caller’s life.</p>

<p>988 is for emotional and behavioral health support with minimal law enforcement involvement unless there is an immediate physical safety threat. The primary goal of the 988 Lifeline is to provide support for people in suicidal crisis or mental health-related distress in the moments they need it most and in a manner that is person-centered. The 988 Lifeline coordinated response is intended to promote stabilization and care in the least restrictive manner. Most crises are managed by counselors working with you to de-escalate the situation and without involving law enforcement.</p>
<p>If you or the person you are calling about is in physical danger, your 988 counselor will contact 911 for emergency services support. Some examples of times when it is appropriate to call 911 for a medical emergency are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A suicide attempt in progress.</li>
<li>A person has a specific suicide or self-harm plan that they are or intend to immediately carry out and they have the means to carry it out.</li>
<li>A person is suspected of being in the midst of an overdose.</li>
<li>A person is experiencing physical symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath that could be either a panic attack or an acute medical emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to reach out for help early in your mental health, suicide, or substance use crisis, so that a caring 988 counselor can help you before you get to this point.</p>

In fact, most peoples’ needs are resolved in their call, text, or chat connection with the 988 counselor and do not require additional immediate intervention. For many others who need more support than what a 988 counselor can provide, a mobile crisis team visit can often provide the help without requiring hospitalization.</p>

<p>In most states, the 211 system provides health and social service assistance information and referrals. The 988 Lifeline crisis counselors provide support for people in suicidal crisis or mental health-related distress in the very moments they need it most. While generally being different in scope, these systems need to be aligned, and in many cases, local 988 Lifeline centers also respond to 211 contacts. We envision that 988 Lifeline crisis centers will need to continue to coordinate with 211 and other warmlines. This will help ensure a collaborative approach regardless of which number a person may use first.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Georouting</strong> is a way of directing phone calls locally without including the caller’s precise location information in the transferred call data. When a person calls the 988 Lifeline, their call would be sent automatically to a crisis call center near their approximate physical location. With georouting, the routing and service providers would not receive detailed information about the exact “pinpoint” location of callers.</li>
<li><strong>Geolocation</strong> is a more general term that refers to a person’s precise geographical location. In most cases, that location information is associated with the device a person accesses a service from. A widely-familiar example of geolocation is the usage of smartphone precise GPS location to provide local services in Apps. The 988 Lifeline has no plans at this time to implement geolocation.</li>

<p>By connecting callers to centers well-versed in their community’s specific services and local resources, georouting helps enhance the relevance and quality of care available to each caller. Many crisis center directors, advocates, people with lived experience, and state and local behavioral health care leaders have expressed the need for calls to be answered by centers within a caller’s state. There are three key reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Care:</strong> Having residents receive local community resources helps improve connections to care and build trust in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> In imminent risk situations where emergency dispatches and rescue procedures are needed, many 988 Lifeline centers have relationships with their local Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) to streamline this process.</li>
<li><strong>Funding:</strong> State and local appropriations are tied to expectations around serving state and local community populations. To budget, scale and size programs appropriately, it is vital to fully understand resource needs and utilization in these communities.</li>

<div class="card card-body">
<p>In October 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted rules to require all wireless carriers to implement georouting for calls to the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline. These rules will facilitate access to the 988 Lifeline’s critical local intervention services by requiring wireless providers to implement georouting solutions for 988 calls to route wireless calls to local crisis centers based on the geographic area associated with the origin of a 988 call rather than by area code, while protecting the privacy needs of the caller. The FCC’s 988 call georouting rule has a compliance deadline of Jan. 13 for nationwide commercial mobile radio service providers and Dec. 14, 2026, for non-nationwide providers. The FCC has also proposed a rule to require text providers to implement georouting for text messages.</p>

<li>Triage/screen a person’s immediate needs, including explicitly screening for suicidality</li>
<li>Assess a person’s emotional health condition</li>
<li>Deescalate/resolve the crisis</li>

</h4>
<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1672674">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>The two primary models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile crisis teams, in which a team of behavioral health staff and peers respond to the person in crisis, and</li>
<li>Co-responder teams, in which a team including law enforcement or emergency medical staff and a mental health professional respond jointly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The appropriate approach in a given situation in a particular community will depend in part on the assessment of risk and imminent threat, as well as the service availability, laws and regulations of the community’s jurisdiction. A small community that has no mobile crisis capacity and that shares mental health staff with other communities may face different constraints than a large urban community with greater resources.</p>

<p>Mobile crisis services are ideally available 24/7; however, their availability currently varies by the location.

In most cases where mobile crisis teams exist, a two-person crisis team is on call and available to respond. Some units use telehealth as a component of the service delivery. The team may be comprised of professionals and paraprofessionals (including trained peer support providers) who are trained in crisis intervention skills and in serving as the first responders to people needing help on an emergency basis.</p>

</button>
</h4>
<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1672679">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>The goals of mobile crisis are to provide assessment, de-escalation, treatment intervention, safety planning, and referral in community settings and in a manner that minimizes the need for hospitalization. Most people with suicidal thoughts will not require involuntary transport or hospitalization. Mobile crisis teams can do a suicide risk assessment to determine the best type of help needed and how to get the person in need that help. When mobile crisis teams determine that hospitalization is necessary due to imminent safety concerns, the team works to engage the person in crisis and meet the preference of the person. Involuntary hospitalization may be needed in circumstances of imminent risk where the other efforts are not successful.</p>

<p>Who funds the 988 Lifeline?</p>

</h4>
<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion active" id="accordionBody1672652">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has invested nearly $1.5 billion into strengthening and expanding 988 Lifeline capacity and services. Prior to this investment, the 988 Lifeline, which began in 2005 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, had been long underfunded and under-resourced. Congress has provided the Department of Health and Human Services funding through the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and Fiscal Year budgets. That total does not include funding for mobile crisis response, certified community behavioral health clinics, or dedicated crisis care-related funds within SAMHSA’s Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, all of which are also critical components supporting the crisis care system.</p>
<p>At the state and territory level, in addition to existing public/private sector funding streams, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2661">National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020</a> allows states to enact new telecommunication fees to help support 988 operations. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) tracks state legislation for 988 funding in a at <a href="https://reimaginecrisis.org/map/">988 Crisis Response State Legislation Map</a>. NAMI also tracks states that have received approval for <a href="https://reimaginecrisis.org/mobilecrisis/">enhanced Medicaid funding for mobile response</a>.</p>

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1672653">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>There are several existing federal resources that can be leveraged to support 988 implementation. Examples from SAMHSA include 988 Lifeline grants to states, territories, and <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grants-dashboard?grants_dashboard__search=%22FG-23-006%22%20%22FG-23-005%22%20%22FG-23-003%22#awards-tab">tribes</a>; the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/fg-23-003">988 Lifeline crisis center follow-up grant</a>; the crisis set-aside through the Mental Health Block Grant; and funding through the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) program. States are also able to leverage Medicaid dollars and State Opioid Response grants. States can find descriptions of these funding sources in the 2025 National Guidelines for a Behavioral Health Coordinated <a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/national-guidelines-crisis-care-pep24-01-037.pdf">System of Crisis Care (PDF | 1.4 MB)</a> and in the <a href="https://www.nasmhpd.org/sites/default/files/988_Convening_Playbook_States_Territories_and_Tribes.pdf">988 Convening Playbook for States, Territories, and Tribes (PDF | 1.1 MB)</a>.</p>
<p>From 2022 to 2024, SAMHSA has provided over 200 grant awards to states, territories, and tribes for 988. The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 gave states the ability to enact new telecommunications fees to financially support 988 operations. Success of 988 rests heavily upon state, territorial and local leadership in leveraging the resources already available in addition to making new investments.</p>

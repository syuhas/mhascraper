<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Educators are often the first to notice mental health problems in children and young adults. Here are some ways you can help your students and their families.</p>
<h2>What Educators Should Know</h2>
<p>You should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/what-is-mental-health/how-to-talk">warning signs</a> for mental health problems.</li>
<li>How to promote <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/children-and-families/school-health">mental health and substance use prevention</a> in schools and on campuses.</li>
<li>Whom to turn to, such as the principal, school nurse, school psychiatrist or psychologist, or school social worker, if you have questions or concerns about a student's behavior.</li>
<li>How to access <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/988">crisis support and other mental health services</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Educators Should Look for in Student Behavior</h2>
<p>Consult with a school counselor, nurse, or administrator and the student's parents if you observe one or more of the following behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling very sad or withdrawn for more than two weeks</li>
<li>Seriously trying to harm oneself, or making plans to do so</li>
<li>Sudden overwhelming fear for no reason, sometimes with a racing heart or fast breathing</li>
<li>Involvement in many fights or desire to badly hurt others</li>
<li>Severe out-of-control behavior that can hurt oneself or others</li>
<li>Not eating, throwing up, or using laxatives to make oneself lose weight</li>
<li>Intense worries or fears that get in the way of daily activities</li>
<li>Extreme difficulty concentrating or staying still that puts the student in physical danger or causes problems in the classroom</li>
<li>Repeated use of drugs or alcohol</li>
<li>Severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships</li>
<li>Drastic changes in the student's behavior or personality</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Educators Can Do in Classrooms and Schools</h2>
<p>You can support the mental health of all students in your classroom and school, not just individual students who may exhibit behavioral issues. Consider the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about mental health by taking a mental health awareness training</li>
<li>Promote social and emotional competency and build resilience</li>
<li>Help ensure a positive, safe school environment</li>
<li>Teach and reinforce positive behaviors and decision-making</li>
<li>Encourage helping others</li>
<li>Encourage good physical health</li>
<li>Help ensure access to school-based mental health supports</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developing Effective School Mental Health Programs</h2>
<p>Efforts to care for the emotional well-being of children and youth can extend beyond the classroom and into the entire school. School-based mental health programs can focus on promoting mental wellness, preventing mental health problems, and providing treatment.</p>
<p>Effective programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote the healthy social and emotional development of all children and youth</li>
<li>Recognize when young people are at risk for, or are experiencing, mental health problems</li>
<li>Identify how to intervene early and appropriately when there are problems</li>
</ul>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-cpnt-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Mental health problems and substance use disorders sometimes occur together. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain substances can cause people with an addiction to experience one or more symptoms of a mental health problem</li>
<li>Mental health problems can sometimes lead to alcohol or drug use, as some people with a mental health problem may misuse these substances as a form of self-medication</li>
<li>Mental health and substance use disorders share some underlying causes, including changes in brain composition, genetic vulnerabilities, and early exposure to stress or trauma</li>
</ul>
<p>More than one in four adults living with serious mental health problems also has a substance use problem. Substance use problems occur more frequently with certain mental health problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/what-is-mental-health/conditions/depression">Depression</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/what-is-mental-health/conditions/anxiety">Anxiety Disorders</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Substance Use Disorders</h2>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>It can be hard to identify a Substance Use Disorder sometimes because people can have a wide degree of functioning and often can hide their alcohol or drug use. Symptoms of substance use disorders may include behavioral changes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop in attendance and performance at work or school</li>
<li>Frequently getting into trouble (fights, accidents, illegal activities)</li>
<li>Engaging in secretive or suspicious behaviors</li>
<li>Changes in appetite or sleep patterns</li>
<li>Unexplained change in personality or attitude</li>
<li>Sudden mood swings, irritability, or angry outbursts</li>
<li>Periods of unusual hyperactivity, agitation, or giddiness</li>
<li>Lack of motivation</li>
<li>Appearing fearful, anxious, or paranoid, with no reason</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical changes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloodshot eyes and abnormally sized pupils</li>
<li>Sudden weight loss or weight gain</li>
<li>Deterioration of physical appearance</li>
<li>Unusual smells on breath, body, or clothing</li>
<li>Tremors, slurred speech, or impaired coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>Social changes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden change in friends, favorite hangouts, and hobbies</li>
<li>Legal problems related to substance use</li>
<li>Unexplained need for money or financial problems</li>
<li>Using substances even though it causes problems in relationships</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recovering From Mental Health Problems and Substance Use</h2>
<p>Someone with a mental health problem and substance use disorder must treat both issues. Treatment for both mental health problems and substance use disorders may include rehabilitation, medications, support groups, and talk therapy.</p>

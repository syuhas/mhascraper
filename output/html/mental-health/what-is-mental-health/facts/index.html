<p><strong>Fact: </strong>Mental health issues can affect anyone. In 2020, about:</p>
<ul>
<li>One in 5 American adults experienced a mental health condition in a given year</li>
<li>One in 6 young people have experienced a major depressive episode</li>
<li>One in 20 Americans have lived with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. In fact, it was the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">second leading cause of death</a> for people ages 10-24. Suicide has accounted for the loss of more than 45,979 American lives in 2020, nearly double the number of lives lost to homicide.</p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns. These mental health conditions are often clinically diagnosable and can be a product of the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors.</p>
<p>Half of all mental health disorders show first signs before a person turns 14-years-old, and three-quarters of mental health disorders begin before age 24.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only half of children and adolescents with diagnosable mental health conditions receive the treatment they need. Early mental health support can help a child before problems interfere with other developmental needs.</p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Most people with mental health conditions are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.</p>
<p>Only 3%–5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness. In fact, people with severe mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of a violent crime than the general population. You probably know someone with a mental health condition and don't even realize it, because many people with mental health conditions are highly active and productive members of our communities.</p>

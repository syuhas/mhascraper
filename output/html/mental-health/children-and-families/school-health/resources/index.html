Examples of these resources include:</p><p><strong>Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)</strong></p><ul><li>In 2022, The Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) made updates to the <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/bright-futures">Bright Futures Program</a> national guidelines, adding universal screening for suicide risk for individuals ages 12 to 21, and new guidance for behavioral, social, and emotional screening.</li><li>The <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/programs/pediatric-mental-health-care-access">Pediatric Mental Health Care Access</a> (PMHCA) program enables pediatric primary care providers to consult with pediatric mental health specialists through teleconsultation to better diagnose, treat and refer children and youth to services for mental health conditions and substance use disorders.</li><li>HRSA’s <a href="https://www.sbh4all.org/">School-Based Health Alliance</a> provides training and technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of health centers to address the unique health needs of school-aged children and improve the health outcomes of underserved youth.</li><li>HRSA awarded nearly $25 million through the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/05/03/hhs-awards-nearly-25-million-expand-access-school-based-health-services.html">Health Center Program School-Based Service Sites (SBSS)</a> funding opportunity to improve and strengthen access to school-based health services in communities across the country.

Expected release is summer 2022.</li></ul><p>As we support our nation’s children and youth, it is imperative that we focus on mental health and wellness, and we must stand ready to identify challenges and intervene quickly. The better we are at promoting positive behavioral health, and the sooner we provide assessment and treatment services, the better the outcomes for our children and youth. We cannot afford to wait. We must act now, and we must act in partnership. Together, we can improve the lives of children and youth across America.</p></div>

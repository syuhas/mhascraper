The collaborative efforts of this program will create and/or improve identification, referral, early intervention, treatment, and support services for students that need specialized support.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Trauma-Informed Services in Schools program is to increase student access to <strong>evidence-based and culturally relevant trauma support services</strong> and mental health care by developing <strong>innovative initiatives, activities, and programs</strong> to link local school systems with local trauma-informed support and mental health systems, including those under the Indian Health Service.</p>
<p>Grantees will develop and/or implement the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative partnerships with at least one local/community trauma-informed support and mental health services system to develop and provide screening, referral, and treatment support services to students and their families.</li>
<li>Develop an implementation plan which would include the following:
	<ul>
<li>A trauma informed support and mental health services plan</li>
<li>A training plan</li>
<li>A family and community engagement plan</li>
<li>A sustainability plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this program, SAMHSA aims to further enhance and improve trauma-informed support and mental health services for children and youth.</p></div>

These major adverse events have the potential to cause catastrophic loss of life and physical destruction. They are often unexpected and can leave whole communities in shock.</p>
<p>People who live through a disaster can experience emotional distress. Feelings of anxiety, constant worrying, trouble sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common responses to disasters before, during, and after the event. Many people are able to “bounce back” from disasters with help from family and the community, but others may need additional support to cope and move forward on the path of recovery. Anyone can be at risk, including survivors living in the impacted areas and first responders and recovery workers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline">Disaster Distress Helpline</a> is open to anyone experiencing emotional distress related to disasters. This includes survivors of disasters; loved ones of victims; first responders; rescue, recovery, and relief workers; clergy; and parents and caregivers. You may call for yourself or on behalf of someone else.</p>
<h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Natural disasters are large-scale geological or meteorological events that have the potential to cause loss of life or property. Severe storms and floods are the most common types of natural disasters reported in the United States. These meteorological events might be preceded by presidential “emergency declarations” requiring state and local planning prior to the event, such as evacuations and protection of public assets.</p>
<p>Natural disasters include:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Human-Caused Disasters</h2>
<p>Human-caused disasters can include industrial accidents, shootings, acts of terrorism, and <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disasters/disaster-types/incidents-mass-violence">incidents of mass violence</a>. As with natural disasters, these traumatic events might cause loss of life or property, could prompt evacuations from certain areas, and overwhelm behavioral health resources in the affected communities. After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, many people in the United States felt less safe and secure. These feelings are really important for living a happy and healthy life, and the loss of security had a big impact on people across the country.</p>
<h2>Other Incidents of Mass Trauma</h2>
<p>Other types of traumatic events can also bring out strong emotions in people. The events could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infectious disease outbreaks – Learn more about <a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/product/coping-stress-during-infectious-disease-outbreaks/sma14-4885">Coping with Stress During Infectious Disease Outbreaks</a> and <a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/product/talking-children-tips-caregivers-parents-and-teachers-during-infectious-disease-outbreaks-0">Talking with Children: Tips for Caregivers, Parents, and Teachers During Infectious Disease Outbreaks</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Disaster Memorial Dates and Activating Events</h2>
<p>The memorial date of a disaster or tragic event can renew feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness in disaster survivors. Certain smells or sounds, such as smoke or sirens, can also activate emotional distress. These and other environmental sensations can take people right back to the event, or cause them to fear that it’s about to happen again. These “<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disasters/memorials-activating-events">activating events</a>” aren’t associated with any particular day on the calendar and can happen at any time.</p>

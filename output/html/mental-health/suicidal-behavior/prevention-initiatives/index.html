<h2>Funding and Grant Programs</h2>
<p>SAMHSA’s Suicide Prevention Branch funds discretionary grant programs focused on suicide prevention, early intervention, crisis support, treatment, recovery, and postvention for youth and adults, including:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/sm-22-016">Community Crisis Response Partnerships</a></h3>
<p>Mobile crisis units serving youth and adults across the lifespan. The purpose of this program is to create or enhance existing mobile crisis response teams to divert people experiencing mental health crises from law enforcement in high-need communities, where mobile crisis services are absent or inconsistent, most mental health crises are responded to by first responders, and/or first responders are not adequately trained or equipped to diffuse mental health crises. Grant recipients use SAMHSA’s <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/national-guidelines-for-behavioral-health-crisis-care-02242020.pdf">National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care: Best Practice Toolkit (PDF | 2.2 MB)</a> as a guide in mobile crisis service delivery.</p>

This has greatly reduced the instances of unnecessary involvement with Law Enforcement and EMS, expediting the appropriate mental health service, directly to the client.</p>

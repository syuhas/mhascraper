<p>To inform their work, the BYSPI team conducted a literature review and assembled and convened a national subject matter expert panel comprised of clinicians, community-based organizations, representatives from federal agencies, and young people with lived experience of surviving a suicide attempt.

<p>Black Youth Suicide Policy Academy</p>

<div class="usa-accordion__content lego-accordion" id="accordionBody1678679">
<div class="card card-body">
<p>The first major activity of the BYSPI was a Policy Academy in July 2023. Eight states were selected based on suicide rates of Black youth and young adults between the ages of 5-24, as well as population data, to create multidisciplinary teams comprised of: state suicide prevention coordinator, crisis center staff, a local clinician, individual(s) with lived experience and affected family member(s), and representatives from the state department of education, colleges and universities (preferably Historically Black Colleges and Universities [HBCU]), community- or faith-based organizations. Each team was paired with SAMHSA staff and a subject matter expert on Black youth suicide prevention and received technical assistance over three days. The goal was to help each team develop a state-specific action plan to implement policy, systems, and environmental change strategies to reduce Black youth suicide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohort 1 (2023): Maryland, Ohio, Louisiana, Oregon, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Pennsylvania</li>
<li>Cohort 2 (2024): Minnesota, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Illinois, Washington DC, Oklahoma, and Tennessee</li>

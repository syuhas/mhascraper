<ul>
<li><strong>Call 911</strong>, if danger for self-harm seems imminent.</li>

<h2>Prevention Strategies and Approaches</h2>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in preventing suicide. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faith communities</strong> can work to prevent suicide simply by helping people navigate the struggles of life to find a sustainable sense of hope, meaning, and purpose, in addition to encouraging individuals to engage in behavioral health care.</li>
<li><strong>Schools </strong>can implement suicide prevention programs that provide early intervention, while workplaces can encourage employees to utilize employee assistance programs that provide mental health resources and a nurturing, supportive environment for all.</li>
<li><strong>Community centers</strong> can host mental health support groups that incorporate wellness activities, and local businesses can promote and encourage mental health awareness by providing resources to employees and customers.</li>
<li><strong>You can contribute</strong> by reviewing suicide-related data, assessing the needs and readiness of your community, organization, tribe, state, or territory for suicide prevention, and by developing and implementing policies, programs, and practices to prevent suicide in these areas. <a href="http://sprc.org/states/">Discover what's happening in your state or territory</a> and explore ways to work with others for a bigger impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effective Suicide Prevention Model</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://sprc.org/effective-prevention/">Effective Suicide Prevention Model</a> from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) provides a flexible framework to develop, implement, and evaluate prevention efforts in various settings. This model emphasizes three key elements—strategic planning, keys to success, and a comprehensive approach—that work together to maximize impact and efficiently use resources.</p>
<h3>Best Practices Registry (BPR)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://bpr.sprc.org/">Best Practices Registry (BPR)</a> from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) features programs and strategies that have been thoroughly reviewed by experts to ensure they align with the latest guidance on suicide prevention. Each listing demonstrated effectiveness in preventing suicide or addressing related factors. If you have a program or intervention, you can submit it for consideration to be included in the BPR.</p>
<h3>Zero Suicide Framework: A Safer Approach to Suicide Care</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://zerosuicide.edc.org/about/framework">Zero Suicide Framework</a> is built on the belief that suicide can be prevented within care systems by improving access, quality, and support. It emphasizes the need for a strong commitment to preventing suicide, creating a culture where it is no longer acceptable, and setting clear goals to eliminate it. This involves organizing services to support those goals and using evidence-based practices proven to reduce suicide risks.</p>

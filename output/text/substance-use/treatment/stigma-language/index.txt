The Power of Perceptions and Understanding: Changing How We Deliver Treatment and Recovery Services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Body

Millions of people in the U.S. live with a substance use disorder. In 2016, there were 20.1 million people, or 7.5 percent, aged 12 or older in 2016 who had a substance use disorder in the past year. In addition, an estimated 8.2 million U.S. adults 18 or older reported having co-occurring disorders. This means that within the previous year, they experienced both a mental illness and a substance use disorder.

Health care providers are often the first contact for addressing their patient’s substance use disorder. There is ample evidence that those who have a substance use disorder often have feelings of shame that impede treatment-seeking. Therefore, it is essential health care providers understand that negative attitudes, beliefs and language can be barriers that prevent those in need from seeking services, or even sharing information, including being in recovery.

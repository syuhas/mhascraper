---------------------------------------
Buprenorphine Pharmacy Lookup Title Block

Section 1262 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 removes the federal requirement for practitioners to have an “X” waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. All practitioners who have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder in their practice if permitted by applicable state law.

Until further notice, states requiring practitioners to have waivers can use this lookup form to confirm that SAMHSA certified the practitioner prior to the elimination of the X-waiver.

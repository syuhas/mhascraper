The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 eliminated the waiver and extended the ability to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD to all practitioners with DEA Schedules II-V on their DEA Registration. Therefore, this list is not inclusive of all practitioners able to prescribe buprenorphine. Please note the list only contains the contact information for practitioners who consent to release their practice information.

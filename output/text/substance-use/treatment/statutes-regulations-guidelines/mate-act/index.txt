What is buprenorphine?
----------------------

Buprenorphine is a Schedule III medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat individuals with opioid use disorder. It significantly reduces mortality, and it can be prescribed in office-based settings.

How does the elimination of the waiver affect me as a practitioner?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All licensed practitioners, except veterinarians, who hold a DEA registration with Schedules II – V authority, and where state law allows, can now prescribe buprenorphine.

When do the changes come into effect?
-------------------------------------

Changes went into effect immediately after the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, on December 29, 2022.

Is there a limit on the number of patients I can treat?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. The patient limits were eliminated along with the waiver.

What are the new training requirements to obtain or renew a DEA registration?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 requires that beginning June 27, 2023, practitioners applying for a new or renewed Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration will need to attest to having completed a total of at least 8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders, as well as the safe pharmacological management of dental pain.

What does this mean for me as a practitioner?
---------------------------------------------

The passage of section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 means that when it is time to renew your DEA Registration or when you apply for a new DEA Registration to prescribe any Schedule II – V controlled medications, you will need to attest on your DEA application that you have either:
  - Completed at least 8-hours of training (training can be cumulative; it does not have to be complete in one session) on opioid/other substance use disorders that has been approved by certain specified organizations; or
  - Hold a current board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Board of Addiction Medicine, or the American Osteopathic Association; or
  - Graduated within five (5) years in good standing from a medical, advanced practice nursing, or physician assistant school in the United States that included successful completion of an opioid or other substance use disorder curriculum. Training must include the treatment and management of patients with opioid and other substance use disorders, and the appropriate clinical use of all drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of a substance use disorder.

What organizations can provide the required training or accredit the respective training organization that provides it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - The American Society of Addiction Medicine
  - The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry
  - The American Medical Association
  - The American Osteopathic Association
  - The American Dental Association
  - The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons
  - The American Psychiatric Association
  - The American Nurses Credentialing Center
  - The American Association of Nurse Practitioners
  - The American Academy of Physician Associates
  - Any other organization accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) or the Commission
  - Any organization accredited by a State medical society accreditor that is recognized by the ACCME or the CCEPR
  - Any organization accredited by the American Osteopathic Association to provide continuing medical education
  - Any organization approved by the ACCME, or the CCEPR

What if I took the training to obtain an X-waiver and prescribed buprenorphine for opioid use disorder?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you previously held a waiver from the DEA and SAMHSA that was granted because you met the training requirements to prescribe buprenorphine, you have already met the criteria, and can attest to meeting the training requirement. However, practitioners who received a 30E waiver (one in which they did not have to complete any special training), must meet the new training criteria under section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023.

Who can tell me if the training I took meets the criteria?
----------------------------------------------------------

The organizations listed by name in section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 approve organizations that provide training. Some of the listed organizations also provide training. If you took qualifying training provided by one of the listed organizations, the training would meet the criteria. If you took a training from an organization whose name is not specifically listed, it is best if you contact the training entity that provided the training to see if their organization or the specific training, they provided is approved by any of the entities named in section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023.

The DEA and SAMHSA do not approve or review training content, and therefore, do not determine whether the training meets this requirement.

Will SAMHSA approve training organizations that provide training but were not specifically named in Section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 or MATE Act?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, at this time, SAMHSA will not approve training organizations who were not specifically named in the Act.

Will SAMHSA approve accreditation bodies who either accredit specific trainings or can then accredit or approve organizations that provide trainings that meet the requirement for DEA registration?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, SAMHSA will not approve accreditation bodies for this purpose. However, there are several accrediting bodies authorized to accredit or approve organizations that provide relevant substance use disorder training.

If I completed at least 8 hours of substance use disorder training during Residency or Fellowship within five years of applying for or renewing my DEA registration, does that count the same way that successful completion of an opioid or other substance us
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, if the 8 hours includes:
  - Treating and managing patients with opioid or other substance use disorders, including the appropriate clinical use of all medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a substance use disorder; or
  - The safe pharmacological management of dental pain and screening, brief intervention, and referral for appropriate treatment of patients with or at risk of developing opioid and other substance use disorders.

Since Residency and Fellowships are tied to medical, advanced practice nursing, and physician assistant schools, these training programs count the same way.

Does curriculum from medical, advanced practice nursing, or physician assistant schools need to be accredited by listed organizations under section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 1263 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 does not stipulate that the curriculum from a medical, advanced practice nursing, or physician assistant school in the United States must be approved by one of the organizations listed in the Act. However, the school from which the practitioner is graduating must be an accredited school of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dental surgery, or dental medicine.

In addition, the training must include 8 hours of training regarding the treatment and management of patients with opioid and other substance use disorders, and the appropriate clinical use of all drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of a substance use disorder, or the safe pharmacological management of dental pain and screening, brief intervention, and referral for appropriate treatment of patients with or at risk of developing opioid and other substance use disorders.

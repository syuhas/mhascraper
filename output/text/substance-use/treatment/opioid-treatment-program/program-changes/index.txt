Notify SAMHSA of Program Changes
--------------------------------
Body

Provides guidance on how to notify SAMHSA about changes in your program and what changes require notification.

Notification of Program Changes
-------------------------------

Per federal regulations opioid treatment programs (OTPs) must notify SAMHSA of changes to their existing program by logging into the
SAMHSA OTP Extranet
and submitting the online Form SMA-162: Application for Certification to Use Opioid Drugs in a Treatment Program.

A separate Form 162 is required for each change. OTPs may not submit multiple changes on one form. On Form SMA-162, OTPs must select the type of change for which they are reporting.

Existing OTP program sponsors should have an individual
SAMHSA OTP Extranet account
. For instructions on accessing your program’s account, contact the SAMHSA OTP Extranet Helpdesk at:
  - 866-348-5741
  - OTP-Help@jbsinternational.com

To establish a SAMHSA OTP Extranet user account,

Who May Submit Form SMA-162?
----------------------------

Only an OTP program sponsor may sign and submit a Form SMA-162. The program sponsor’s name and contact information, including telephone number and email address are required. An acknowledgement email will be sent to the sponsor after the form is submitted online. The sponsor will need to electronically sign the form to complete the submission process via a link supplied in the confirmation email. Once reviewed and approved, SAMHSA will send an email containing the approval letter.

If further information is required, SAMHSA will contact the program sponsor.

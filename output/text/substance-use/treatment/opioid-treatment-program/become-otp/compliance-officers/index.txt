SAMHSA Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) Compliance Officers

SAMHSA’s OTP Compliance Officers process new and renewal certifications for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs). In addition, SAMHSA’s OTP Compliance Officers provide OTPs with ongoing guidance and support.

Compliance officers will evaluate periodically the performance of each accreditation body primarily by inspecting selected OTPs and by evaluating the accreditation body’s survey reports. This evaluation determines whether the surveyed and accredited OTPs complied with the Federal opioid treatment standards.

Compliance officers will review requests for exceptions to 42 CFR Part 8. For-cause inspection may be conducted as deemed necessary to ensure OTPs are in compliance and meet treatment standards.

They also work directly with the
Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) and
State Opioid Treatment Authorities
(SOTAs) to ensure OTPs meet all federal and state requirements to provide care for individuals with
opioid use disorders
under the
Certification of Opioid Treatment Programs, 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 8
.

42 CFR Part 8 Regulation Video Series - Snapshots for Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Body

SAMHSA has produced a video series to highlight key changes to 42 CFR Part 8, the regulations that set standards for care provided by opioid treatment programs (OTPs). The video series provides an overview of the first major regulatory updates in more than two decades, the heart of which is a fundamental shift to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) as a chronic health issue, focusing on patient-centered care, grounded in shared decision-making between individuals and their health care providers.

This shift is embodied in several key changes that expand access to care, enhance the workforce encourage collaboration, and remove barriers to treatment, including allowing the use of telehealth for some aspects of care, reducing admission requirements, and incorporating flexibility for take-home medication.

These historic changes recognize the significant role OTPs play in the specialty behavioral health care system, help foster integration of behavioral and physical health services, strengthen the workforce, and promote recovery.

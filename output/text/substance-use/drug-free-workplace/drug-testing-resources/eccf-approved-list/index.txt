Title

Electronic Custody and Control Approved Lab List
------------------------------------------------
Body

The Division of Workplace Programs (DWP) keeps an updated list of drug-testing laboratories with approved Electronic Custody and Control Form (ECCF) systems.

Before an HHS-certified test facility can use a Federal ECCF for regulated specimens, the test facility must submit a detailed plan and proposed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the ECCF system for HHS review and approval (through the National Laboratory Certification Program - NLCP). Proposed systems must be reviewed on-site by the NLCP prior to implementation.

The following list of laboratories with HHS approval to implement an ECCF system for use with regulated testing has been compiled by the NLCP. This list does not constitute an endorsement of the ECCF system. It reflects the approval for the listed laboratory to use the reviewed ECCF system for regulated specimens.

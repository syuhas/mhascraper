Prescriptions
-------------

Prescription drug misuse
is when someone takes a medication the wrong way.
  - Taking too much, or too often, or too long.
  - Using it for something it wasn’t prescribed for ― the feeling it gives you, to relieve tension, sleep, or be alert or study.
  - Taking a medication that wasn’t prescribed to you ― getting it from a family member or friend.
  - Taking it in a way other than directed (such as crushing pills).
  - Taking it with alcohol or other drugs.

Common prescriptions ― which can be misused and/or lead to addiction ― include:
  - Pain relievers ― such as opioids
  - Stimulants ― such as ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) medication
  - Sedatives and Tranquilizers ― for anxiety or sleep

For pain,
know your options
. Ask your doctor:
  - Are you recommending a medication?If so, is it an opioid?What other options do I have (non-opioid medications, physical therapy, alternative therapies, self-care, or high-tech treatments)?
  - How do I safely stop taking my medication?
  - What should I expect of the medication (will it decrease pain, rather than eliminate pain)?
  - What should I do if my pain treatment isn’t working?

Opioids
-------

Opioid overdose is life-threatening. Overdose can happen, even with a prescription opioid. Naloxone can reverse an opioid overdose.

Fake Pills
----------

Criminal drug networks are mass-producing
fake prescription pills (PDF | 5.6 MB)
― and marketing them as the real thing. They’re often sold on mainstream social media sites and websites. So they’re available to anyone ― including kids.

Many
fake pills
look just like real medications, such as:
  - Oxycodone (Oxycontin®, Percocet®)
  - Hydrocodone (Vicodin®)
  - Alprazolam (Xanax®)
  - Stimulants like amphetamines (Adderall®)

Fake pills often contain fentanyl ― and can be deadly:
  - DEA lab tests found that 6 out of every 10 pills with fentanyl contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. A lethal dose of fentanyl (2 milligrams) – is equal in size to about 10-15 grains of table salt.
  - Animal tranquilizers (even more potent than fentanyl) have also been found in fake prescription pills and illicit drugs.

Your medications should:
  - Come from a licensed, accredited medical professional.
  - Be prescribed to you ― not to someone else.
  - Be dispensed by a licensed pharmacist at a pharmacy.

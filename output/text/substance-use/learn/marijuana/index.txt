Title

Marijuana and CBD
-----------------
Intro

Marijuana use comes with
risks
to health. Today’s marijuana is stronger than ever before.

States that have legalized marijuana regulate the drug in widely different ways ― and often it’s not being checked for its ingredients, purity, strength, or safety.

CBD Products
------------

Cannabidiol (CBD) ― a compound found in marijuana ― doesn’t cause a “high.”

But
CBD products
(sold in grocery stores, drug stores, health food stores, or medical marijuana dispensaries) are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
  - So there’s no federal standards for their content, purity, or potency.
  - No matter what the label says, the actual ingredients might be different (and might include dangerous synthetic compounds, pesticides, or other impurities).

Kids’ Exposure
--------------

When you’re around someone who is smoking marijuana, the
smoke gets into your system too
.

Marijuana edibles
(like gummies, chocolates, candies, baked goods, ice cream, popcorn, sodas) often look like regular treats. One edible can contain several times the adult dose of THC (the mind-altering part of marijuana).
  - A child who eats an edible canoverdose. This can be mild ― or severe (needing an Emergency Room or admission to a hospital).
  - Severe cases in young children often involve slow or shallow breathing, slow heart rate, and other problems of a slowed central nervous system.
  - If a child eats an edible, callPoison Control(800-222-1222). If symptoms seem severe, call 911.

Tobacco, E-cigarettes, and Vaping
---------------------------------
Body

Do you know what’s in your e-cigarette or vape? The
aerosol
― that you breathe in and exhale ― can contain:
  - Nicotine – which is addictive
  - Cancer-causing chemicals
  - Heavy metals – such as nickel, tin, and lead
  - Flavorings – such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to serious lung disease
  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
  - Ultrafine particles – that reach deep into the lungs

The Smoke
---------

There are more than
7,000 chemicals
in commercial tobacco smoke. (Such as: ammonia, benzene, butane, hydrogen cyanide, and toluene.) This includes hundreds of chemicals that are toxic, and about 70 that can cause cancer.

There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke can cause heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer in people who don’t smoke. Children are especially vulnerable.

Health Effects
--------------

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S.

Smoking
harms nearly every organ in the body
― heart and blood vessel disease; lung disease; cancer (almost anywhere in your body); and impacts to your bones, eyes, teeth, gums, fertility and pregnancy.

When You Quit
-------------
  - In minutes: Your heart rate drops.
  - In 24 hours: Nicotine level in your blood drops to zero.
  - In several days: Carbon monoxide in your blood drops to the level of someone who doesn’t smoke.
  - Over time, you decrease your risks of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. You increase your ability to support a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.

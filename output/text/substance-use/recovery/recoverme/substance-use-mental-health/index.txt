RecoverMe: Substance Use and Mental Health
------------------------------------------
Body

Substance use and mental health are deeply connected. Throughout your recovery, taking care of your mental health while improving your relationship with drugs and/or alcohol makes setbacks less likely and improves your mind, body, and overall wellbeing.

The Connection Between Substance Use and Mental Health
------------------------------------------------------

Millions of young adults are living with mental health or substance use conditions, and many are living with both. It’s important to understand how substance use and mental health are connected and how improving one positively impacts the other.

Substance use and mental health conditions may be connected because:
  - Certain drugs or alcohol can cause people to experience symptoms of a mental health condition.
  - Mental health challenges can sometimes lead to alcohol or drug use, as some people with a mental health condition may misuse these substances as a form of self-medication.
  - Substance use and mental health conditions share some underlying causes, including brain chemistry, genetics, stress, or trauma.

The RecoverMe Campaign

Issue Overview
: According to the
2023 National Survey on Substance Use and Health
, nearly half (49.6%) or 16.0 million young adults aged 18 to 25 reported having a mental health or substance use condition in the past year.

In response to this data, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) developed RecoverMe, a national campaign that connects young adults with resources to help them manage mental health and substance use challenges, together.


Campaign Audience
: The primary audience is young adults, aged 18–25, who currently are and want to continue to be in recovery. The campaign will also reach young adults who want to be in recovery and are in an active process to get help with their drug and/or alcohol use and mental health challenges.

SAMHSA recognizes that substance use and mental health conditions can affect young adults in unique ways and are shaped by personal experience, background, and geographic location. This campaign will consider these influences to ensure support is relevant to all young adults.

Campaign Goal
: Increase the number of young adults who are taking steps towards long-term recovery.

Campaign Approach
: RecoverMe connects young adults to empowering, practical, and encouraging resources to support their individual journey with substance use and mental health challenges. Through these resources, RecoverMe:
  - Aims to encourage young adults to seek help by highlighting that recovery is not only possible for everyone but is essential for living a life that feels authentic to them.
  - Educates young adults about the interconnection between substance use and mental health in their recovery.
  - Helps young adults understand that recovery is a journey and aims to normalize these challenges through community connection.

SAMHSA’s RecoverMe Supports Young Adults Facing Substance Use and Mental Health Challenges

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s
RecoverMe campaign
connects young adults with resources that help them manage their substance use and mental health challenges, together. Designed for those who want to be or are in recovery, the campaign provides resources to support them through these interconnected journeys.

RecoverMe was developed in response to 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data that young adults report the highest unmet need for both substance use treatment and mental health treatment. In the past year:
  - The percentage of people aged 12 and older with a substance use disorder in the past year was highest among young adults aged 18 to 25 (27.1% or 9.2 million people); and
  - The percent of adults aged 18 or older who had any mental illness in the past year was highest among young adults aged 18 to 25 (33.8% or 11.5 million people).1

RecoverMe encourages those in recovery to seek the support that feels right for them, lean on an active recovery community, and view recovery as an avenue to further enhance their overall wellbeing.

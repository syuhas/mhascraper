My Recovery, My Journey
-----------------------

Recovery is a process, a journey, and is about getting the support you need to keep living a life that feels authentically you. It’s about your mental health, managing your relationship with drugs and/or alcohol, and finding joy and connection in the face of life’s ups and downs. Your journey is unique, and you are not alone.

Many young adults face challenges with drugs, alcohol, and mental health and are likely navigating the same things you are. When you work on your recovery, you join a community of people who can support you through empathy, respect, and mutual empowerment.

Recovery is possible for everyone. No matter where you are on your journey, RecoverMe can help you find support that feels right for you.

Title

The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intro

The ICCPUD provides national leadership in federal policy and programming to support state and community activities that prevent and reduce underage drinking. The ICCPUDâ€™s role is especially important in light of these key facts:
  - Alcohol remains the number one substance used by people under age 21.
  - Binge drinking (consuming 4 or more drinks at a time by females and 5 or more drinks by males) is a common consumption pattern among underage drinkers.
  - Underage drinking, especially binge drinking, results in many public health harms and societal costs, including deaths from traffic crashes; sexual assaults and other violence; and changes to normal brain development.

ICCPUD's Policy Academy for Implementing Community-Level Policies to Prevent Alcohol Misuse (Policy Academy) is a groundbreaking opportunity to improve the health and wellbeing of people living in the U.S.

Taking place from April 2024 through March 2025, the Policy Academy is a free, year-long opportunity for selected coalitions to engage in local and state-level policy development to prevent and reduce underage drinking and harms related to excessive drinking.

The Policy Academy offers opportunities to collaborate with leading experts on alcohol policy, learn policy strategies and best practices from experienced prevention experts, and engage with coalitions from across the United States.

What is The Policy Academy?
---------------------------
  - A collaboration among ICCPUD and SAMHSA’s National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory, led by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)
  - Held from April 2024 through March 2025, with required monthly webinars and an in-person meeting immediately following attendance at the Alcohol Policy 20 Conference in Arlington, VA, in May 2024
  - Free and includes travel to and lodging at the Alcohol Policy 20 Conference
  - Limited to 28 participants from 14 coalitions (two representatives per coalition)
  - An important and exciting opportunity to improve public health

Policy Academy Goals
--------------------
  - Reduce demand for, the availability of, and access to alcohol by persons under the age of 21
  - Build the capacity of community coalitions, states, tribes, territories, and jurisdictions interested in and committed to using evidence-based tools to establish a multifaceted approach to preventing and reducing underage drinking
  - Work towards implementation of evidence-based local and state alcohol policies

Enrollment is Closed

The deadline for the letter of intent (LOI) was February 1, 2024.

ICCPUD Events and Community Engagement
--------------------------------------
Intro

Because most of the effort to reduce underage drinking is done at the state and local levels, Congress tasked ICCPUD to regularly seek the input of and consult with the nationwide community of prevention experts, state and local government workers, nonprofit staff and volunteers, parents, caregivers, and others who are working hard to reduce underage drinking. To carry out this responsibility, ICCPUD will hold quarterly webcasts to provide data and resources, seek input, and exchange ideas.

-------------------------------------------
Body

Technical Review Subcommittee
-----------------------------

The ICCPUD is convening a Technical Review Subcommittee on Alcohol Intake and Health. The Subcommittee will serve as an ongoing subcommittee of the ICCPUD to provide leadership, oversight, and consultation related to the review of current scientific evidence on the relationship between alcohol intake and related health outcomes. The Subcommittee comprises ICCPUD member agency representatives who are responsible for guiding and setting policies or have scientific expertise in alcohol intake and health research. The Subcommittee includes representatives from the following agencies:
  - U.S. Department of Agriculture
  - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health
  - Agency for Health Care Research and Quality
  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  - Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy
  - Indian Health Service
  - National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute
  - National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
  - Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

The ICCPUD Subcommittee will review all available literature, synthesize the data and conclusions from the Scientific Review Panel. The Subcommittee will assess the scientific evidence provided by the SRP in conjunction with the NASEM study findings related to health effects of alcohol intake among adults and provide a synthesis of the data and summarize the science for the 2025 Report to Congress. This information will also be provided to HHS and USDA for consideration during the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Scientific Review Panel
-----------------------

As part of its regular activity, ICCPUD is supporting a Scientific Review Panel (SRP), comprised of external scientific experts, that will analyze the current scientific evidence on youth and adult alcohol intake and health risks and provide outcomes and findings to the Subcommittee.

The alcohol intake and health study will be conducted by experts in disease prevention and public health and include scientists from diverse backgrounds representing a range of career levels including mid-career researchers. The Subcommittee has expertise on alcohol consumption in the following areas:
  - Public health strategies related to alcohol policies, programs, and practices
  - Alcohol epidemiology
  - Health effects of alcohol
  - Dietary guidance policy
  - Cancer epidemiology
  - Data quality and analysis
  - Systematic reviews
  - Biostatistics

Developing a Scientific Protocol and Methodology
------------------------------------------------

A
Scientific Protocol and Methodology of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study (PDF | 656 KB)
will be developed for performing a series of studies assessing the relationship between alcohol intake and related health conditions; these studies will be completed by leading experts with experience conducting meta-analyses, relative risk estimates, and systematic reviews related to alcohol intake and health. The studies will assess the current, best, and most applicable scientific evidence on the relationship between consumption of alcohol and health outcomes in the following areas:
  - Chronic alcohol use and the development of health conditions
  - Estimates on the relationship between alcohol use and injury risk
  - Lifetime risks of alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity by alcohol intake
  - Burden of disease in the United States related to alcohol intake and health

The SRP will conduct a series of studies on alcohol intake and health, providing the best available science to the Subcommittee on the implications of alcohol intake and health, including on the relationship between chronic alcohol use and health conditions, the relationship between alcohol use and injury risk, lifetime risks of alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity, and U.S. burden of disease related to alcohol intake and health. The SRP will provide all study findings related to alcohol use and health to the Subcommittee.

Information Request Through Public Comment 2025 Draft
-----------------------------------------------------

The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (ICCPUD) is posting for public comment the draft report of scientific findings of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study.

Released on January 15, 2025, the draft study findings is the next step in transparency, scientific rigor and integrity as USDA and HHS are issuing a second request for
public comment in the Federal Register on the draft findings of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study (PDF | 1.9 MB)
. The request for public comment will solicit answers to the following questions:
  - Are the topic areas defined in the Draft Report on Alcohol Intake and Health sufficient for understanding the relationship between alcohol and health?
  - Are the results and public health outcomes presented clear, understandable, and transparent?
  - Are the risks and benefits identified understandable?
  - Are strategies to minimize bias clearly described?
  - Are there additional data sources or scientific information that should be considered to estimate the risk of alcohol consumption on specific health outcomes or to provide a comprehensive understanding of the burden of alcohol-related diseases?

Information Request Through Public Comment 2024 Draft
-----------------------------------------------------

Background
----------

The ICCPUD first began its work in looking at factors affecting underage alcohol use including the relationship between alcohol consumption and health among youth and adults in December 2021 as part of the ICCPUD operational and data committee meetings. This work was included as part of the 2021 ICCPUD Comprehensive Plan. In February of 2022, two members of the ICCPUD (the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) representative and the US Department of Agriculture representative) requested that the ICCPUD undertake a study on alcohol consumption and health to provide greater input on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans related to alcohol. In April 2022, this request was approved, and the ICCPUD, operating on behalf of the HHS Secretary, proceeded to establish a Technical Review Subcommittee to begin the work to conduct the studies and identify leading experts in alcohol.

It is important to note that HHS and USDA have a long history of engaging Federal interagency workgroups to conduct scientific reviews and provide information to inform the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The request to the ICCPUD is not unique. Examples of separate processes and subcommittees that have been used in forming recommendations for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in the past, include, but are not limited to:
  - Healthy Food Environments (CDC Community Preventive Service Task Force)
  - Oral Health (CDCandNIH)
  - Food Safety (FoodSafety.gov)
  - Specific Nutrient Recommendations (Dietary Reference Intakes)
  - Human milk, infant formula, and health outcomes (AHRQ systematic reviews)
  - Seafood (FDA/EPA Advice about Eating Fish)
  - Eating Disorders (National Institute of Mental Health)
  - Physical Activity (Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PDF | 14.6 MB))
  - Evaluation of nutrition intake compared to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations (Healthy Eating Index)
  - Consumer education on the Dietary Guidelines (MyPlate Consumer Education Resources)
  - White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health

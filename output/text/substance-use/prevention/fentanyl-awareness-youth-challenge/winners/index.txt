FentAlert Challenge Winners
---------------------------
Intro

SAMHSA is excited to announce the winners of its
FentAlert Challenge
, which took a bottom-up, peer-led approach ― with ideas for youth, by youth.

The Challenge sought innovative ideas from U.S. youth, age 14-18, to develop a community strategy to better educate their peers about fentanyl and fake pills ― and help prevent drug overdose deaths.

Congratulations to the winners, the honorable mentions, and our thanks to every young person who participated and is helping drive the conversation in their community.

“Dark Road” – Washington
------------------------

A group of youth from Green Hill School came together, wrote a song, and shot a music video with a single focus: fentanyl awareness. The group tells a story, set to music, that helps reflect their personal experiences in their own lives, with peers, with family, and in their communities ― and the realities of life in an institution. Created in partnership with The Bridge Music Project.

“Escape Room” – Maryland
------------------------

An innovative way to teach peers about fentanyl and fake pills, with a hands-on, interactive, engaging approach from Queen Anne’s County Drug Free Coalition’s Student Ambassadors. The team designed an escape room, including plans for: partnerships, an educational approach (the design, a storyline, a closure room to extend the experience), location, publicity, and budget.

“Project FentaNO!” – New York
-----------------------------

An online campaign that creates a series of videos, posts them on social media, and shares to reach over 100,000 youth. Video topics include: fake pills (and the need to get medications only from a trusted pharmacy), emerging drug contaminants (like xylazine), the symptoms of fentanyl overdose, and the benefits of naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses.

“SAFE Youth Ambassadors” – Florida
----------------------------------

Students Advocating Fentanyl Education (SAFE) is a peer-to-peer organization that trains teen ambassadors to set up SAFE Clubs in their schools and communities (in multiple states). SAFE created a multimedia presentation, and trains other teens to deliver it to their peers. SAFE hosts free naloxone distribution events (as well as a teen-centered Instagram account), and partners with local and state organizations.

“Show Don’t Tell" – New Jersey
------------------------------

Explores how videos can show (rather than tell), with engaging, animated visuals that: employ a unique perspective, get straight to the point, and capture the attention of teens and young adults. Encourages young animators to create short, animated videos that inspire trending topics on social media. Tips: know your audience (kids and teens are smarter than they’re given credit for), don’t drag out your video (get to the point quickly), and be creative (put a spin on people’s perceptions).

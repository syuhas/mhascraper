It’s never too early to talk with your children about the risks of underage drinking and other drug use. Research suggests that one of the most influential factors in healthy childhood development is a strong, open relationship with a parent. Though it may not seem like it, children really hear your concerns, and it’s important that you discuss the risks of using alcohol and other drugs with them.

How does Screen4Success work?
-----------------------------

Screen4Success is a quick and easy way to identify areas where someone may benefit from more support. It also provides local and national resources to help address those concerns. You can use the tool for self-screening, or you can send it to someone you are concerned about. You can also help that person fill out the screener—this provides opportunities for discussion in the moment—or they can complete it on their own if that’s not possible.

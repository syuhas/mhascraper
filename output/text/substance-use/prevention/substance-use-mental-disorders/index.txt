Prevention of Substance Use
---------------------------
Body

Prevention and early intervention strategies can reduce the impact of substance use in America’s communities.

Prevention activities work to educate and support individuals and communities to prevent the use and misuse of drugs and the development of substance use disorders.

Substance use and mental disorders can make daily activities difficult and impair a person’s ability to work, interact with family, and fulfill other major life functions. Mental and substance use disorders are among the top conditions that cause disability in the United States. Preventing mental or substance use disorders or co-occurring disorders and related problems is critical to behavioral and physical health.

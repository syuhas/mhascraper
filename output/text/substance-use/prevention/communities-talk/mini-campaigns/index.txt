Mini-Campaigns

Mini-campaigns are one way SAMHSA can direct resources to learn about and provide strategies around specific priorities and/or audiences who may not be in mainstream prevention conversations. For example, some campaigns and data are available when it comes to college drinking but not for other young adults this age who are not attending college.

Similarly, the prevalence of screening for substance use disorders among primary care providers can be low and likely results from a lack of provider knowledge, provider discomfort with discussing this sensitive issue with youth, and confidentially constraints.

Through these mini-campaigns, SAMHSA helps bridge these knowledge gaps and provides strategies that can advance prevention. Below, you can find more information about each of these mini-campaigns, including resources from SAMHSA and others that are geared for prevention professionals, pediatricians, and youth.

Young adults ages 18–25, also defined as transition-age youth, are at high risk for substance misuse—particularly alcohol and marijuana use.

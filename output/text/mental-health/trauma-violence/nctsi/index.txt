About NCTSI
-----------

The National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI) raises awareness about the impact of trauma on children and adolescents as a behavioral health concern.

Congress, recognizing the serious mental health impact of traumatic events on children, adolescents, and families, authorized in 2000 the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI), as part of the Children’s Health Act. NCTSI’s goal is to transform mental health care for children and adolescents affected by trauma throughout the country by improving the quality of community-based trauma treatment and services and increasing access to effective trauma-focused interventions.

NCTSI develops and implements:
  - Evidence-based interventions to reduce the debilitating mental health impact of traumatic experiences on children and adolescents
  - Collaborations with all systems of care where children and adolescents who have experienced trauma receive services
  - Successful education and training approaches, including training practitioners in trauma-informed and evidence-based treatment and services
  - Data collection and evaluation activities
  - Education and awareness raising with policymakers regarding trauma, resilience, and recovery
  - Product development for professionals, policymakers, families, youth, and the public
  - Partnerships with youth, families, and other consumers

A Collaborative Approach
------------------------

Through this initiative, a collaborative network of experts was created to further the development and dissemination of evidence-based clinical interventions for systems that serve children, adolescents, and families.

The
National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)
includes the Category I, II, and III grantees as well as any NCTSN affiliates. Current NCTSI grantees are automatically a part of the NCTSN. Affiliates are former NCTSI grantees, including individuals and/or organizations from previous NCTSI grants, who continue their involvement in the NCTSN. Affiliate members, made up of more than 160 formerly funded NCTSN members, continue to contribute to the national mission and ongoing work in their states and local communities.

Funding and Grant Programs
--------------------------

SAMHSA’s Suicide Prevention Branch funds discretionary grant programs focused on suicide prevention, early intervention, crisis support, treatment, recovery, and postvention for youth and adults, including:

Community Crisis Response Partnerships (link: /grants/grant-announcements/sm-22-016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile crisis units serving youth and adults across the lifespan. The purpose of this program is to create or enhance existing mobile crisis response teams to divert people experiencing mental health crises from law enforcement in high-need communities, where mobile crisis services are absent or inconsistent, most mental health crises are responded to by first responders, and/or first responders are not adequately trained or equipped to diffuse mental health crises. Grant recipients use SAMHSA’s
National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care: Best Practice Toolkit (PDF | 2.2 MB)
as a guide in mobile crisis service delivery.

The CCRP grant has allowed our agency to expand our mobile crisis services to a 24/7/365 program, setting us apart as the first in our state to offer around the clock mobile response. This has greatly reduced the instances of unnecessary involvement with Law Enforcement and EMS, expediting the appropriate mental health service, directly to the client.

Garrett Lee Smith Campus (link: /grants/grant-announcements/sm-24-004)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Suicide prevention initiatives for students on college campuses. This program supports a comprehensive, evidence-based public health approach that: (1) enhances mental health services for students, including those at risk for suicide, depression, serious mental illness / serious emotional disturbances, and/or substance use disorders (SUDs) that can lead to school failure; (2) prevents and reduces suicide, mental illness, and SUDs; (3) promotes help-seeking behavior; and (4) improves the identification and treatment of at-risk students so they can successfully complete their studies. Watch the
GLS Campus Suicide Prevention New Grantee Orientation (1 hour, 33 minutes)
.

This marks 3 years of enhanced mental health and wellbeing support for students. We’ve learned that high usage of after-hour support for students through our program lowers the barriers that may otherwise prevent students from seeking help.

Garrett Lee Smith State/Tribal (link: /grants/grant-announcements/sm-24-005)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community-based suicide prevention for youth and young adults up to age 24. This program supports states and tribes with implementing youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies in educational settings, juvenile justice and foster care systems, substance use and mental health programs, and other organizations to: (1) increase the number of organizations that can identify and work with youth at risk of suicide; (2) increase the capacity of clinical service providers to assess, manage, and treat youth at risk of suicide; and (3) improve the continuity of care and follow-up of at-risk youth.

It has been wonderful work made possible through the SAMHSA grant and we are thrilled each chance we get to share these programs with others to help support other grants and especially our youth.

Native Connections/Tribal Behavioral Health (link: /native-connections)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Community-based suicide prevention for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth through age 24. The purpose of this program is to prevent suicide and substance misuse, reduce the impact of trauma, and promote mental health among AI/AN youth. It aims to reduce the impact of mental health and substance use disorders, foster culturally responsive models that reduce and respond to the impact of trauma in AI/AN communities, and allow AI/AN communities to facilitate collaboration among agencies to support youth through the development and implementation of an array of integrated services and supports with the involvement of AI/AN community members in all grant activities.

National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (link: /grants/grant-announcements/sm-23-017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community suicide prevention for adults 18 and over. The purpose of this program is to implement suicide prevention and intervention programs for adults (with an emphasis on older adults, adults in rural areas, and AI/AN adults) that help implement the
2021 Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Implement the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (PDF | 708 KB)
. This program uses a broad-based public health approach to suicide prevention by enhancing collaboration with key community stakeholders, raising awareness of suicide prevention resources, and implementing lethal means safety.

The NSSP grant has not only allowed us to sustain our efforts to prevent suicide by expanding our capacity to engage in lethal means safety, connectedness, economic stability, education, and follow-up efforts across the state, but also given local partners resources to implement innovative strategies for suicide prevention.

SAMHSA’s Black Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative
--------------------------------------------------
Summary

SAMHSA’s Black Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative (BYPSI) was created by staff in SAMHSA’s Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) to address the growing rate of suicide deaths among Black youth and young adults. Utilizing mechanisms within and external to SAMHSA, the goal of the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative is to reduce the suicidal thoughts, attempts, and deaths of Black youth and young adults between the ages of 5-24 across the country. The BYPSI team includes representatives across CMHS and collaborates with other Offices within SAMHSA including the National Policy Laboratory and the Office of Behavioral Health Equity.

September 2024 | SAMHSA’s Black Youth Suicide Webinar
-----------------------------------------------------

SAMHSA’s Suicide Prevention Branch hosted a fireside chat on Black youth suicide prevention, featuring speakers from SAMHSA, young adults with lived experience, and experts in suicide prevention among Black youth. Research shows that from 2018 to 2021, Black individuals aged 10 to 24 experienced a 37% increase in suicides, the largest increase among racial groups. This webinar highlighted the efforts of SAMHSA's Black Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative and focus on actions to support youth in their communities. The webinar provided valuable insights from experts and young people about addressing Black youth suicide and how to embed equity in suicide prevention efforts.

Subject Matter Expert Panel Meeting
-----------------------------------

To inform their work, the BYSPI team conducted a literature review and assembled and convened a national subject matter expert panel comprised of clinicians, community-based organizations, representatives from federal agencies, and young people with lived experience of surviving a suicide attempt. Following these initial events, the BYSPI team developed an internal strategic plan to guide the initiative and serve as a foundation for future work.

Black Youth Suicide Policy Academy
----------------------------------

The first major activity of the BYSPI was a Policy Academy in July 2023. Eight states were selected based on suicide rates of Black youth and young adults between the ages of 5-24, as well as population data, to create multidisciplinary teams comprised of: state suicide prevention coordinator, crisis center staff, a local clinician, individual(s) with lived experience and affected family member(s), and representatives from the state department of education, colleges and universities (preferably Historically Black Colleges and Universities [HBCU]), community- or faith-based organizations. Each team was paired with SAMHSA staff and a subject matter expert on Black youth suicide prevention and received technical assistance over three days. The goal was to help each team develop a state-specific action plan to implement policy, systems, and environmental change strategies to reduce Black youth suicide.
  - Cohort 1 (2023): Maryland, Ohio, Louisiana, Oregon, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Pennsylvania
  - Cohort 2 (2024): Minnesota, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Illinois, Washington DC, Oklahoma, and Tennessee

Learning Collaborative
----------------------

At the conclusion of the Black Youth Suicide Policy Academy, state teams are invited to participate in a learning collaborative, led by SAMHSA Staff in the Suicide Prevention Branch. The purpose of the learning collaborative is to:
  - ensure state teams have the opportunity to foster and maintain connections made at the policy academy;
  - facilitate a forum for information exchange, brainstorming, and problem-solving around planning and implementing Black youth suicide prevention;
  - provide support to state teams as they plan and implement Black youth suicide prevention.

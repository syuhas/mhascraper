Suicide is complex and determined by multiple combinations of factors, such as mental illness, substance misuse, trauma, painful losses, exposure to violence, and social isolation.

Below are the warning signs of suicide for youth and adults. Act if you notice these signs among a family members, friend, neighbor, coworker, or others. Suicide risk is greater if a behavior is new or has increased, and if it seems related to a painful event, loss, or change.

The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention is a 10-year, comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention and provides concrete recommendations for addressing gaps in the suicide prevention field. There has not been an updated strategy in over a decade.

American Indian
---------------

Young American Indian men—especially in the Northern Plains—are at high risk for suicide compared to other groups. While many of the risk factors are the same as those affecting other groups, young American Indian men face additional challenges such as historical trauma, cultural distress, poverty, geographic isolation, and suicide in the community that can cause increased stress. Based on the “seven generations” philosophy of American Indian culture, this video builds a powerful connection across the generations, while offering a powerful message to young males to seek help if they are having thoughts of suicide. “Seven Generations” was produced with the participation of several American Indian tribes and cultural advisors on location in Montana. SAMHSA is grateful for their assistance.

Alaska Native
-------------

Young men living in Alaska are greatly affected by suicide, wrestling with stigma and silence. In 2017, Alaska had the second highest rate of suicide in the nation. But new prevention efforts and knowledge are making headway in counteracting challenges such as mental health and substance abuse problems. Using a generational approach to prevent suicide, this video appeals to the pride and strength of Alaska Native culture, using storytelling to remind young males that it is up to their generation to carry forward their proud culture. “Heart of the Land” was produced with the help of a Native Alaskan film director, cultural advisors and members of several tribes in Alaska. SAMHSA is grateful for their assistance.

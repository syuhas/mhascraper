Mental Health
-------------
Intro

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.

Good mental health positively affects our lives and enables us to meet lifeâ€™s responsibilities and find happiness and meaning. Poor mental health can have negative impacts on our physical health, how we feel about ourselves, and how we interact with the world and those around us.

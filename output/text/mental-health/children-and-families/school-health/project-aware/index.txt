Project AWARE
-------------
Intro

The purpose of the Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resiliency in Education) program is to develop a sustainable infrastructure for school-based mental health programs and services. AWARE grantees build collaborative partnerships with the State Education Agency (SEA), Local Education Agency (LEA), Tribal Education Agency (TEA), the State Mental Health Agency (SMHA), community-based providers of behavioral health care services, school personnel, community organizations, families, and school-aged youth.
Body

Grantees leverage partnerships to implement mental health-related promotion, awareness, prevention, intervention, and resilience activities to ensure that school-aged youth have access and are connected to appropriate and effective behavioral health services. With this program, SAMHSA aims to promote the healthy social and emotional development of school-aged youth and prevent youth violence in school settings.

The program has increased mental health literacy among the schools and communities, removed barriers to find care, and ensured cultural relevance for all school programs. With the continuous support from SAMHSA, Project AWARE proceeds to focus on improving school climate and trauma informed programming to improve the care for school-aged youth.

Early Childhood Mental Health Programs
--------------------------------------
Intro

As a part of its mission to reduce the impact of substance use and mental illness on our communities, SAMHSA funds programs that promote and support the health and wellness of young children and their families.

Through early childhood grant funding, SAMHSA strives towards a future where:
  - All young children have the opportunity to thrive in all domains of development- physical, cognitive, spiritual, emotional, and social
  - Caregivers have access to supports and services to meet the needs of young children in their care; this includes supports and services to help caregivers build their own resilience and capacity for nurturing caregiving
  - In the context of strong caregiver relationships and nurturing environments, young children can then thrive socially and emotionally, building their own resilience to support lifelong mental health
  - Healthy children and families build a healthier future for all of us and our communities

SAMHSA currently funds three early childhood mental health grant programs and a Center of Excellence:

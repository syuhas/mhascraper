Mental Health for Children and Families
---------------------------------------
Overview Text

Talking to children about mental health and illness can be an opportunity for parents and caregivers to provide their children with information, support, and guidance. Mental and substance use disorders in families can impact family dynamics. And for children who could benefit from treatment, it can still be hard for parents and caregivers to identify issues or find help and treatment.

People can experience a wide range of emotions before and after a disaster or traumatic event. There’s no right or wrong way to feel. However, it’s important to find healthy ways to cope when these events happen.

Coping Tips

Coping strategies include preparation, self-care, and finding support systems. You or a loved one can use the following coping tips:
  - Take care of yourself.Eat healthy, avoid alcohol and drugs, and get some exercise, like a walk or deep breathing, to relieve stress.
  - Reach out to family and friends.Talk to someone you trust about your feelings. If you have children, let them know it's okay to express their emotions.
  - Limit news consumption.Constant news can increase anxiety and make some people relive the event over and over. Reduce how much you watch or listen to.
  - Get good sleep.If you're having trouble sleeping, avoid caffeine, electronics, and alcohol before bed. Journal your thoughts if you wake up.
  - Establish a routine.Stick to regular meal and sleep schedules. Include fun activities to look forward to.
  - Avoid major life decisions.Big changes, like career shifts, are harder to manage after a disaster.
  - Understand there will be changes.Disasters can disrupt lives long-term, including loss of homes, schools, or jobs. Be patient with the recovery process.
  - Care for pets or connect with nature.Animals and nature can help with emotional recovery. Volunteer at shelters or spend time outdoors when it’s safe.
  - Know when to ask for help.Pay attention to signs of persistent stress, depression, anxiety, or substance use. Seek help when emotional distress becomes difficult to manage.
  - Join a support group.Support groups offer a safe space to share experiences and feel less alone.
  - Consult a financial adviser.Loss of home or work can create financial stress. A financial adviser can help you plan and access helpful resources.

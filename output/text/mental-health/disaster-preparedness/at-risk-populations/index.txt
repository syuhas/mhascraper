Emotional Distress and Trauma Across At-Risk Populations
--------------------------------------------------------
Body

Trauma has no boundaries regarding age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status. It is a common experience for both adults and children, particularly for those with mental health or substance use disorders or those affected by disasters. Addressing trauma is critical to effective behavioral health care and the recovery process.

Populations at higher risk may include:
  - Children and Youth
  - Adults
  - First Responders and Recovery Workers
  - Women and Girls at Risk of Intimate Partner or Family Violence

Children and Youth
------------------

Children are among the most vulnerable after traumatic events or disasters. Traumatic stress occurs when a child (0-18 years) feels intensely threatened by an event they experience or witness. Young people often need time and emotional support to feel secure again after experiencing trauma or a disaster. Their reactions are influenced by how parents, relatives, teachers, and caregivers respond. These individuals provide comfort and stability, and play a vital role by maintaining normal routines or establishing new ones after a crisis. With proper caregiving and access to trauma-informed services, many children recover and thrive.

Adults
------

Adults impacted by disaster are faced with the challenge of balancing roles as first responders, survivors, and caregivers. They are often overwhelmed by the magnitude of responsibility and immediate task of crisis response and recovery. They must also take time to address their physical and emotional needs as well as those of their family members and community.

First Responders and Recovery Workers

First Responders and Recovery Workers
-------------------------------------

First responders and recovery workers—like fire fighters, police officers, military personnel, and crisis counselors—are not only physically and emotionally tested during an emergency, but they also may have loved ones in the area for whom they are concerned. They also are often the last to seek help for work-related stress.

Women and Girls at Risk of Intimate Partner or Family Violence

Women and Girls at Risk of Intimate Partner or Family Violence
--------------------------------------------------------------

Trauma and disasters disrupt families and communities, increasing stress and the risk of violent behavior, including intimate partner and family violence. Women and girls are especially vulnerable, particularly when disaster-related resources for reporting crimes are limited or unavailable. What may appear as conflict between partners or family members could be part of a larger pattern of abuse. During disaster recovery, the risk of violence rises as women and girls may be displaced to overcrowded, co-ed shelters with inadequate security, heightening their sense of isolation and vulnerability.

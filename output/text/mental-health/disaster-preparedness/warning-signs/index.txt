-----------------------------------------------------
Body

It is common to feel stress symptoms before or after a crisis.
Natural and human-caused disasters
can have a devastating impact on peopleâ€™s lives because they sometimes cause physical injury, damage to property, or the loss of a home or place of employment. Anyone who sees or experiences this can be affected in some way.

Most stress symptoms are temporary and will resolve on their own in a fairly short amount of time. For some people, particularly
at-risk populations
, these symptoms may last for weeks or even months and may influence their relationships with families and friends.

Symptoms may include:
  - Eating or sleeping too much or too little
  - Anger, feeling edgy or lashing out at others
  - Overwhelming sadness
  - Pulling away from people and things
  - Not connecting with others
  - Lack of energy or always feeling tired
  - Feeling like you have to keep busy
  - Having unexplained aches and pains, such as constant stomach-aches or headaches
  - Feeling helpless or hopeless
  - Excessive smoking, drinking, or using drugs, including prescription medications
  - Worrying a lot of the time; feeling guilty but not sure why
  - Thinking of hurting or killing yourself or someone else
  - Having difficulty re-adjusting to home or work life

SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants (SERG)
---------------------------------------
Intro

SAMHSA Emergency Response Grant (SERG) program is a SAMHSA-wide grant opportunity, inclusive of mental health and substance use prevention, response, and recovery services, that authorizes SAMHSA to act immediately under emergency circumstances that create a behavioral health crisis, where the crisis overwhelms the behavioral health system or creates behavioral health service needs that do not fit existing behavioral health resources. SERG funds are “funds of last” resort and cannot supplant existing resources.

SERG funding enables public entities to address emergency behavioral health crises when existing resources are overwhelmed or unavailable. A SERG grant is open to all 50 US states, tribes, territories, and the District of Columbia.

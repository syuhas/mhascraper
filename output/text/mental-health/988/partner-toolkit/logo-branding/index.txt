Title

988 Logo and Branding
---------------------
Intro

The 988 brand embodies the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's ideals and goals. Built on a concept of connecting with those who are experiencing suicidal crisis or struggling with their mental health, the 988 Lifeline brand primarily seeks to offer a sense of hope. We want that hope to encourage people to text, call, or chat 988 if they or a loved one are in need of support.

Used as intended, the 988 brand provides a cohesive look and feel across 988 materials.

This brand guide will be updated and expanded as SAMHSA continues audience testing.

988 Logo Lockup
---------------
  - The 988 logo focuses on clean geometry and simplistic typography. The ‘988’ element is boldest, providing instant brand recognition.
  - In both horizontal and stacked forms, the lockup is designed to mark 988 communications with the assurance of support. The lockup must be used without modification to maintain brand integrity and consistency. Care should be taken to provide enough contrast for lockup legibility.
  - The horizontal form should be theprimary lockupused on all materials and webpages. Should space not allow for the primary lockup to be used, there is a secondary, stacked version available.
  - Always be sure to use approved logo files, and never attempt to redraw or re-create any part of the logo as each element has been carefully configured.
  - The logo is designed with a minimum clear space that is equal to the height of the “9” in 988. To create the greatest impact, allow even more space around the lockup. Do not allow photos, typography, or other graphic elements to enter the minimum clear space area.
  - There are three color versions of the logo: Black, Navy Blue, and White. All logos are available in English and Spanish.

Navy Logo (Primary):
The preferred full-color variation to be used on light backgrounds. Color contrast should adhere to 508 accessibility standards.



Black Logo:

Changing the logo in any way will weaken its impact and detract overall brand recognition. Avoid using or adapting the logo in the ways exemplified below.


Logos for Use Inside Videos
---------------------------

The video “bug” version of the logo is intended to be used across all video assets. It removes the words, “SUICIDE & CRISIS,” leaving behind a more condensed, “988 LIFELINE.”

The video bug should be in the same placement throughout the length of the video, be the same size, and same opacity.

Color Palette
-------------

The 988 color palette offers complementary colors that speak of hope, calm, and reassurance. The interplay between contrasting cool and warm colors hints at natural emotional rhythms.

The
primary palette
provides the foundation of the 988 brand and in most instances, should be used for 70% of a graphic’s color treatment.

The
secondary palette
should be used to communicate emphasis. However, in certain marketing materials, the secondary palette may come forward as the main color treatment to best relate to the overall aesthetic and tone of the piece, so long as other core brand elements remain in place.

The
tertiary palette
consists of neutral colors that can be used when the layout requires a calmer, more neutral overall tone.

Note: Text color-contrast ratios should always comply with Section 508 accessibility standards.

Photography
-----------
  - The overall tone for 988 imagery should feel authentic, hopeful, thoughtful, and relatable.
  - Photos should be people-focused, with limited background distractions. 988 strives for photos that show an equal range of male/female/non-binary representation. When shown in a group setting, people in the photos should convey a feeling of support and encouragement.
  - Things to avoid in 988 imagery: Overly stylized images; people whose expressions are dark, emotional, or depressed; people with extremely happy or excited expressions.
  - See ourNational Paid Marketingpage for examples of photography and type in use.

Icons
-----
  - Icons can be used to visually communicate ideas. The 988 iconography style combines outlined and solid organic shapes to create clear and approachable graphics.
  - On light backgrounds, icons should be navy with an accent color from the secondary color palette.
  - When used on dark backgrounds, the navy should be changed to white and lighter tints of the secondary color palette should be used when necessary to maintain 508 compliance.
  - The accent color can be changed as needed to any of the secondary colors in the 988 color palette in order to align with other assets in a layout.

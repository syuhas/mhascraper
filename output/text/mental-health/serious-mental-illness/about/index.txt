SAMHSA is committed to promoting the prevention, treatment, and recovery of mental disorders and to bringing hope to adults who have serious mental illness (SMI) and children with serious emotional disturbances (SED).

According to
SAMHSA’s 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (PDF | 642 KB)
, 14.6 million adults, or 5.7%, reported having SMI in the past year. And according to the
Uniform Reporting System (URS) 2022 data (PDF | 186 KB)

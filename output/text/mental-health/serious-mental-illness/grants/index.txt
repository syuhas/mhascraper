  - Assertive Community Treatment (ACT): The ACT grant program supports the establishment or expansion and maintenance of ACT programs for individuals with SMI. ACT is an evidence-based services-delivery model considered to be one of the most effective approaches to delivering services to individuals with the most severe impairments associated with SMI.

  - Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (AOT): The AOT grant program supports the implementation and evaluation of new AOT programs in communities with the goal of improving the health and social outcomes of individuals with SMI. AOT is a court-ordered community-based outpatient mental health treatment program for individuals with SMI who have an inability to engage with outpatient treatment. The program is designed to work within the civil court system that supports engagement with community-based treatment as an alternative to more restrictive levels of care.
  - Behavioral Health Partnerships for Early Diversion: The Early Diversion grant program aims to establish or expand programs that divert adults with SMI or a co-occurring disorder from the criminal justice system to community-based services prior to arrest and booking.
  - Transforming Lives Through Supported Employment: The Supported Employment grant program supports the implementation and sustainment of high quality, evidence-based supported employment programs for adults with SMI or co-occurring mental and substance use disorders.

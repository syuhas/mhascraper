For Parents and Caregivers of Children

As a parent or caregiver, you want the best for your children or other dependents. You may be concerned or have questions about certain behaviors they exhibit and how to ensure they get help.

What to Look For
----------------

It is important to be aware of warning signs that your child may be struggling. You can play a critical role in knowing when your child may need help.

Consult with a school counselor, school nurse, mental health provider, or another health care professional if your child shows one or more of the following behaviors:
  - Feeling very sad or withdrawn or easily irritated for more than two weeks
  - Seriously trying to harm or kill themselves, or making plans to do so
  - Experiencing sudden overwhelming fear for no reason, sometimes with a racing heart or fast breathing
  - Getting in many fights or wanting to hurt others
  - Showing severe out-of-control behavior that can hurt oneself or others
  - Not eating, throwing up, or using laxatives to make themselves lose weight
  - Having intense worries or fears that get in the way of daily activities
  - Experiencing extreme difficulty controlling behavior, putting themselves in physical danger or causing problems in school
  - Using drugs or alcohol
  - Having severe mood swings that cause problems in relationships
  - Showing drastic changes in behavior or personality
  - A drop in their school performance

Because children often can't understand difficult situations on their own, you should pay particular attention if they experience:
  - Loss of a loved one
  - Divorce or separation of their parents
  - Any major transition—new home, new school, etc.
  - Traumatic life experiences, like living through a natural disaster
  - Teasing or bullying
  - Difficulties in school or with classmates

  - Ask your child's primary care physician if your child needs further evaluation by a specialist with experience in child behavioral problems
  - Ask if your child's specialist is experienced in treating the problems you are observing
  - Talk to your medical provider about any medication and treatment plans

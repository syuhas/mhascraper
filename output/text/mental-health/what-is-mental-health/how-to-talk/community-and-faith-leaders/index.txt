For Community and Faith Leaders
-------------------------------
Body

Faith and community leaders are often the first point of contact when individuals and families face mental health problems or traumatic events. In fact, in times of crisis, many will turn to trusted leaders in their communities before they turn to mental health professionals.

Creating Community Connections for Mental Health
------------------------------------------------

When leaders know how to respond, they can help educate individuals and families about mental health, increasing awareness of mental health issues and making it easier for people to seek help. Community connectedness and support are also important to the long-term recovery of people living with mental illnesses.

Faith communities are also in a unique position to reach many of the millions of Americans who struggle with serious thoughts of suicide each year. Many people having thoughts of suicide feel hopeless, trapped, and often struggle to face another day. Suicidal thoughts are often accompanied by a spiritual crisis or deep questioning about the purpose of life.

Faith leaders who are better able to recognize the
signs of suicide
, and know how to respond, can serve as an expanded safety net for those most in need.

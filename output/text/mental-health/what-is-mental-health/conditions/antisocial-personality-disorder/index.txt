Antisocial Personality Disorder
-------------------------------
Body

Antisocial personality disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others.

Causes
------

The cause of antisocial personality disorder is unknown. Genetic factors and environmental factors, such as child abuse, are believed to contribute to the development of this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. More men than women are affected.

Intentional fire-setting and cruelty to animals during childhood are linked to the development of antisocial personality.

Symptoms
--------

A person with antisocial personality disorder may:
  - Be able to act witty and charming
  - Be good at flattery and manipulating other people's emotions
  - Break the law repeatedly
  - Disregard the safety of self and others
  - Have problems with substance misuse
  - Lie, steal, and fight often
  - Not show guilt or remorse
  - Often be angry or arrogant

Treatment
---------

Antisocial personality disorder can be difficult to treat. Typically, individuals with this condition don't seek treatment on their own.

Behavioral treatments, such as those that reward appropriate behavior and have negative consequences for negative behavior, may work in some people. Talk therapy has also been shown to possibly help. Treating co-morbid conditions such as ADHD, depression, and PTSD can also be helpful.

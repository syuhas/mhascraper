🔍 Checking line: 'Why Collaborative Care? Most individuals receive mental health and substance use care from primary care physicians, and need has grown exponentially in the wake of COVID-19. Collaborative care is a validated, evidence-based approach that efficiently integrates physical and behavioral health in primary care settings and has been shown to save $6 in health care spending for every $1 invested. 80+ randomized trials have demonstrated CoCM’s effectiveness, and it is a covered service in the Medicare program and among most commercial health insurers. Maryland Medicaid recipients continue to be unfairly denied access to this effective service delivery model, despite clinically significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms among the small number of individuals served by Maryland’s very limited Medicaid pilot.'
